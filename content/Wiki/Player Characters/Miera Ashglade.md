# History
## Life in the [[Etral Kingdom]]

[[Miera Ashglade]] is a 23 year old human woman from a nearly destitute noble house, [[House Ashglade]]. This house was once known for its bountiful harvests, but in recent generations have fallen into many pitfalls that have hindered there agricultural efforts severely. To avoid complete bankruptcy [[Miera Ashglade]]'s hand in marriage has been offered to [[Vasher Shadowmire]], the notoriously sleezy heir apparent of [[House Shadowmire]], who has struggled to find a suitable marriage partner for many years. A clause of the marriage would sign all of the property of [[House Ashglade]] to [[House Shadowmire]] and all but guarantee [[Vasher Shadowmire]]'s rise to the head of his house someday. However, about a year ago [[Miera Ashglade]] decides to run away before the marriage can commence. While fleeing her family home she decides to take her family's heirloom, the [[Trademaster's Ring]]. Enraged by [[Miera Ashglade]]'s departure [[Vasher Shadowmire]] ordered his house's henchman to track her down and bring her back as his inheritance of [[House Ashglade]] depends on their marriage. While on the run [[Miera Ashglade]] managed to find work doing odd jobs in the different places within the [[Etral Kingdom]] that she had visited since escaping, but she never stayed for long in fear of being caught by [[Vasher Shadowmire]]. Eventually her travels brought her to [[Dronn]] the capital of the [[Etral Kingdom]] where she once again began looking for work across the city. ^life-in-the-etral-kingdom
