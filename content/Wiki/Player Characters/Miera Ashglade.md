# History
## Life in the [[Etral Kingdom]]

[[Miera Ashglade]] is a 23 year old human woman from a nearly destitute noble house, [[House Ashglade]]. This house was once known for its bountiful harvests, but in recent generations have fallen into many pitfalls that have hindered there agricultural efforts severely. To avoid complete bankruptcy [[Miera Ashglade]]'s hand in marriage has been offered to [[Vasher Shadowmire]], the notoriously sleezy heir apparent of [[House Shadowmire]], who has struggled to find a suitable marriage partner for many years. A clause of the marriage would sign all of the property of [[House Ashglade]] to [[House Shadowmire]] and all but guarantee [[Vasher Shadowmire]]'s rise to the head of his house someday. However, about a year ago [[Miera Ashglade]] decides to run away before the marriage can commence. While fleeing her family home she decides to take her family's heirloom, the [[Trademaster's Ring]]. Enraged by [[Miera Ashglade]]'s departure [[Vasher Shadowmire]] ordered his house's henchman to track her down and bring her back as his inheritance of [[House Ashglade]] depends on their marriage. While on the run [[Miera Ashglade]] managed to find work doing odd jobs in the different places within the [[Etral Kingdom]] that she had visited since escaping, but she never stayed for long in fear of being caught by [[Vasher Shadowmire]]. Eventually her travels brought her to [[Dronn]] the capital of the [[Etral Kingdom]] where she once again began looking for work across the city. ^life-in-the-etral-kingdom

# Notes

- Was trained by an instructor to use a rapier
- She wanted to attend the [[Military Academy]] in [[Dronn]] however her parents used her tuition to fund the house for another year
- Party girl
- While in [[Dronn]] she spent much of her time and money on night fencing instructions, from veterans she found at local taverns. They were old blade masters that were notorious drunks and she would pay for her lessons by getting the drunk at the tavern. This prevented her from partying. Although she did learn how to shoot whiskey
