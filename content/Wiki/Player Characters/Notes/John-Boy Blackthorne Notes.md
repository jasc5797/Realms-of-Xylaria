# Notes
## To Be Determined

- the item is just like an instrument the entity uses to entrap people to do their bidding. I would say some kind of classic evil because it's like a devils bargain situation. And I think I sent details about the latest bargain being to assassinate a cleric in Sylmare. John Boy wouldn't necessarily know these details but could be the cleric is using his influence to push for a crack down on dark magic and artifacts the entity relies on to do its bidding.
- Also for later on there could be the encountering of a madman who was under a similar curse and escaped at the cost of his sanity, who can reveal more details to John Boy
- Now that I think of it, could go all in and say John Boy is being manipulated by a powerful vampire. Considering he was given minor vampiric abilities (undying, life steal)
- Would you consider John boy becoming more vampire-like as time goes on? Like he is almost a vampire thrall sort of thing. And each time he dies he becomes more vampiric
