## To Be Determined

- [[Gnutz Snatcher]] is not initially aware the [[Clan Tanithil]] and [[Ozai]] the leader of the [[Veilbound Syndicate]] had a hand in the destruction of his childhood village
- [[
- a low level thug, not prolific but like maybe known in some crime circles from odd jobs and what not
- I kind of wanted to name the dude ozai which gave me a brilliant twist idea
- Ozai hinting that he's the fire lord, but the crime lord is the one that burnt down the village not the human and elf contingent. And he's been lying to gnutz the whole time
## Potential Character Hooks

- HeÂ could have a hidden talent for tracking or survival due to his upbringing in the woods
- He might have a phobia of fire or open spaces due to the trauma of the village attack
- A recurring dream or nightmare about the attack could haunt his sleep
- A chance encounter with a survivor of the attack could stir old emotions and force him to confront his past
