# History
## Life in the [[Etral Kingdom]]

[[Edwin Ravenswood]] is a 67-year-old human man from a defunct noble house in the [[Etral Kingdom]] that had fallen on hard times. His house, [[House Ravenswood]], bore a coat of arms depicting an eponymous raven in flight. Similarly, [[Edwin Ravenswood]] has always had a familiar in the shape of a raven. As a youth he received classical schooling, and recently continued his pursuit of higher education at 18 by attending the [[Royal Academy]] in [[Dronn]]. He took to scholarly work quickly and never stopped to do much else with his life. During his many years working at the [[Royal Academy]] he became the last living member of his family, even out living his older brother(s?). As he grew older he realized how much of life he missed out on. Therefore he felt his only option was to extend his life, indefinitely. ^life-in-the-etral-kingdom
## Meeting [[Miera Ashglade]]

During [[Miera Ashglade]]'s time in [[Dronn]] working odd jobs she was hired to bring a magical item to the [[Royal Academy]] to be identified. Eventually this item made it to [[Edwin Ravenswood]], who had gained much prestige investigating magical items during his long tenure at the [[Royal Academy]]. While investigating the item he discovered it was called the [[Orb of Eternity]], and that it may be able to help him towards his ultimate goal of immortality. However, he also discovers that it has a powerful curse. After some time [[Edwin Ravenswood]] believed that he was able to disband the curse, and decided to attempt to attune to the [[Orb of Eternity]]. The attunement did not go as planned, as the curse was not completely lifted, resulting in [[Edwin Ravenswood]] reverting to his younger self at the age of 19. This also had the effect of him forgetting everything he lived through, reverting back to the memories he had when he was that age. In a panic, and not understanding what was going on, he fled from the [[Royal Academy]] to the streets of [[Dronn]] with the [[Orb of Eternity]] in hand. When [[Miera Ashglade]] returned to the [[Royal Academy]] to retrieve the [[Orb of Eternity]] she found that the item has been missing and was presumably still with [[Edwin Ravenswood]]. Eventually she managed to track down [[Edwin Ravenswood]], only to find him being corner by a shady group of what appeared to be cutpurses. After dispatching that group [[Miera Ashglade]] and [[Edwin Ravenswood]] find that one of the members of the group was carrying an [[Unknown Letter]] that requested that both the [[Orb of Eternity]] and [[Trademaster's Ring]] be tracked down and taken by any means necessary. ^meeting-miera-ashglade
## Escape to [[Sylmare]]

[[Edwin Ravenswood]] and [[Miera Ashglade]] decide it would be best to flee [[Dronn]] in order to escape this unknown group that has taken an interest in them. [[Edwin Ravenswood]] tries to convince [[Miera Ashglade]] that they should seek refuge with his family, [[House Ravenswood]], however [[Miera Ashglade]] recalls from her time in noble society that [[House Ravenswood]] is long defunct. [[Edwin Ravenswood]] is not convinced however until they travel to the ruins of his family's keep. [[Edwin Ravenswood]] suggests they head to a shop named [[Wobblesproket's Wonders]] that is located in [[Sylmare]]. He says that its owner a [[Tinker Gnome]], named [[Horatio Wobblesprocket]], is a good friend and is well versed in magical items. [[Edwin Ravenswood]] believes he may be able to help them figure out more about their magical items. ^escape-to-sylmare
## Arrival in [[Sylmare]]

When [[Edwin Ravenswood]] and [[Miera Ashglade]] arrive in [[Sylmare]] they quickly discover that [[Horatio Wobblesprocket]] has long since passed. However, they find that the current owner of [[Wobblesproket's Wonders]] is his grandson, [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]]. [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]] offers to still investigate the magical items, however he thinks it will take some time to gather more information about them. In the meantime he suggests they find some work, and points them in the direction of the hiring office for [[Clan Tanithil]]'s mercantile company. Here they are hired on to work odds jobs for the clan while they wait to hopefully learn more from [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]]. ^arrival-in-sylmare

## Meeting [[Gnutz Snatcher]] and [[John-Boy Blackthorne]]

[[Edwin Ravenswood]], [[Gnutz Snatcher]], [[John-Boy Blackthorne]], and [[Miera Ashglade]] are all assigned to work as a party running odd jobs after being hired by [[Clan Tanithil]]. Over the next few months the party settled into a comfortable routine, and gained a reputation for getting results. The higher ups of [[Clan Tanithil]] took notice of the parties actions and provided the party with permanent base of operations within [[Sylmare]]. Here the party is working under a half-elf named [[Emelden]], who is one of the stewards of [[Clan Tanithil]]'s mercantile company. ^meeting-gnutz-snatcher-and-john-boy-blackthorne
