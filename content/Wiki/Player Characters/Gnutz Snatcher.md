# History 

## Early Life in the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]

[[Gnutz Snatcher]] was born into a quiet bugbear village, a life far removed from the dangers of the wider world. His idyllic childhood was shattered when a coalition of elves and humans launched a surprise attack on his village. Terrorized by the overwhelming force, Gnutz fled into the dense woods, leaving behind his home, family, and everything he knew. ^early-life-in-the-trisfir-kingdom
## Working for the [[Veilbound Syndicate]]

Alone and frightened, [[Gnutz Snatcher]] wandered for days until he was found by a shadowy figure - a powerful crime overlord of the [[Veilbound Syndicate]] with a keen eye for talent. Recognizing the potential in the young bugbear, the overlord took [[Gnutz Snatcher]] under their wing, training him in the art of thievery and survival. Under the overlord's tutelage, [[Gnutz Snatcher]] transformed from a scared child into a hardened criminal. He learned to pick locks, move silently, and blend into the shadows. His once innocent mind became sharp and calculating, as he mastered the gritty realities of the underworld. Over the years, [[Gnutz Snatcher]] has worked countless jobs for his overlord, from stealing priceless artifacts to infiltrating heavily guarded strongholds. While he has grown accustomed to his life of crime, the memories of his destroyed home and lost family never truly fade. A deep-seated anger and longing for revenge against elves and humans continues to burn within him, fueling his ambition and driving his actions. ^working-for-the-veilbound-syndicate
