---
# Description

Tall and lean with dark hair often in a ponytail. John-boy is usually wearing black.

Despite his grim appearance, John-boy has a silver tongue and a roguish charm. He can be jovial and quick-witted, often masking his inner turmoil with humor and bravado. However, those who look closely can see the weight of centuries in his eyes, and the fleeting moments of melancholy that slip through his carefully crafted façade. John-boy is a man driven by an unquenchable thirst for freedom, yet forever bound by the chains of his past.


**Where is he from?** John-boy Blackthorn hails from Duskwood, a small, grimy town on the outskirts of the Etral Kingdom. Nestled in the shadow of the Ironleaf Forest, Duskwood is a place where the land is as harsh as its people. The town is known for its rough-and-tumble inhabitants — miners, loggers, and outlaws — who live on the fringes of society, far from the grand cities of the kingdom. The tavern where John-boy was raised stood on the town’s main thoroughfare, a hub of gossip, trade, and trouble.

- **Counsel of the Damned:** The knuckles constantly whisper to John-boy, offering him guidance, warnings, or threats. These whispers can grant him advantage on Insight or Perception checks, but they can also be distracting, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws at the GM's discretion.
    - **Eternal Bargain:** Grimshackle has bound itself to John-boy’s soul. As long as he wears them, he cannot die of natural causes, and even fatal wounds will not claim his life — at a price. Each time he is brought back from the brink of death, the dark spirit within the knuckles compels him to complete a task, often one of dubious morality or great danger.
    - **Tethered Soul:** When attuned to Grimshackle, John-boy is bound to the material plane, making him resistant to death's grasp. When reduced to 0 hit points, he can automatically stabilize once per long rest without rolling death saving throws. However, this defiance of death exacts a toll, causing a permanent reduction to his maximum hit points each time it is used, reflecting the tightening grip of the curse.
    - **Vitality Siphon:** Once per short rest, Grimshackle can channel the life force of those struck by the knuckles, healing John-boy for a portion of the damage dealt.

# History

## Early Life

John-boy Blackthorn was born the son of a tavern maid and an unknown father. As he grew up on the rough outskirts of a working town, John-boy learned that the world was not kind to the weak. He became adept at surviving by any means necessary, turning to thievery and eventually becoming a notorious highwayman. His life of crime was marked by daring heists and narrow escapes, and he soon earned a reputation as both a gentleman thief and a ruthless bandit. One fateful night, John-boy ambushed a strange traveler with a chest of rare artifacts. Among the treasures was an ancient, cursed blade that whispered to him as he drew it from its sheath. The voice in the sword promised power and protection in exchange for his soul. Desperate to escape the gallows and continue his life of freedom, John-boy took the bargain. Now, John-boy roams the world as a man out of time, haunted by the choices he made. The blade has extended his life far beyond a normal human's, allowing him to cheat death more times than he can remember. But with each rebirth, the curse tightens its grip, and John-boy knows that one day his debt will come due. ^early-life
