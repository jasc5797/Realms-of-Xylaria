Wondrous Item. Common
This simple flask is ordinary in every aspect, but will
always contain a single droplet of liquid after being
emptied.
A new last drop will replenish each time the flask is
emptied and closed. The flask can still be filled
externally and used as normal, and the last drop will
always be made of the last liquid that was added to the
flask.
