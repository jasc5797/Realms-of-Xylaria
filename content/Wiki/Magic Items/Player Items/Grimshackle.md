# Attributes

*Weapon (Club), Rare (requires attunement by a Requires attunement)*
# Description

- **Counsel of the Damned:** The knuckles constantly whisper to you, offering guidance, warnings, or threats. These whispers can grant advantage on Insight or Perception checks, but they can also be distracting, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws at the GM's discretion.
- **Eternal Bargain:** [[Grimshackle]] binds itself to your soul. As long it is worn, you cannot die of natural causes, and even fatal wounds will not claim your life — at a price. Each time you are brought back from the brink of death, the dark spirit within the knuckles compels you to complete a task, often one of dubious morality or great danger.
- **Tethered Soul:** When attuned to [[Grimshackle]], you are bound to the material plane, making you resistant to death's grasp. When reduced to 0 hit points, you can automatically stabilize once per long rest without rolling death saving throws. However, this defiance of death exacts a toll, causing a permanent reduction to your maximum hit points each time it is used, reflecting the tightening grip of the curse.
- **Vitality Siphon:** Once per short rest, you can channel the life force of those struck by the knuckles. You gain 5 temporary hit points plus 1 for each class level.
