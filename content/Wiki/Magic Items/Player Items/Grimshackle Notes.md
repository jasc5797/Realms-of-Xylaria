- The [[Grimshackle]] acts as a remote controlling device over its wielder and cannot be removed by non-magical. 
- The item is cursed so that even if the hand was cut off it would regrow with 24 hours and the item would appear again. 
- Its controller is a member of a vampire cult in the [[Etral Kingdom]]
- Initially the [[Grimshackle]] has little control over the wielder, however with each death comes consequences
- Per the contract/bargain, upon each death and revival the wielder is compelled to perform a task for the controller
- Additionally upon each death the wielder falls deeper into a vampiric thrall like state and is more susceptible to commands from the controller
