The **[[Orb of Eternity]]** is an intriguing and powerful artifact tied to **[[Edwin Ravenswood]]** and central to his story. Its mechanics are both defensive and offensive, giving **Edwin** the potential to mitigate damage and unleash devastating shockwaves, while its attunement and history suggest a deeper mystery tied to **Edwin’s** quest for immortality. Here are some expanded thoughts on how the **[[Orb of Eternity]]** could function mechanically, narratively, and how it could develop in the campaign:

### 1. **Orb Mechanics**
   - **Damage Negation**: The orb’s ability to negate damage based on a d20 roll provides **Edwin** with a strong defensive tool. The damage negation based on **Wizard Level** (1 + Wizard Level) makes it scale well as **Edwin** grows stronger. This makes the orb both a unique shield and a mark of **Edwin’s** connection to the artifact as he increases in power.
   - **Charge System and Shockwave Attack**: The 10-foot shockwave that the **[[Orb of Eternity]]** can release adds an interesting offensive capability, especially since **Edwin** can store up to 3 charges. The charges being linked to the damage negation mechanic makes it a tactical decision—does he take the hit to build up charges, or does he avoid using the orb and conserve it for powerful shockwave attacks later?
     - **Range and Damage**: A 10-foot radius shockwave deals 1d6 per charge, so at full capacity, it can deal up to 3d6 damage in a small area. This could serve as a last resort defensive move or a way for **Edwin** to clear space when surrounded by enemies. The relatively short range suggests it’s most useful for close-quarters combat or in tight situations where enemies group around him.
     - **Action Economy**: Since the orb’s shockwave takes an action to use, **Edwin** must choose carefully when to activate it, as it could be a critical part of his survival when spells or other defenses aren’t viable.

### 2. **Narrative Potential**
   - **Immortality and the Curse**: The **[[Orb of Eternity]]** is deeply tied to **Edwin’s** desire for immortality, but its curse has reverted him to a younger version of himself. This narrative element introduces a lot of intrigue—what exactly is the curse, and can it be broken fully? Perhaps the more **Edwin** uses the orb, the more the curse affects him, with each use having subtle, mysterious consequences that build over time.
   - **Mysterious Origins**: The **[[Orb of Eternity]]**'s history could be far more ancient and dangerous than **Edwin** realizes. Perhaps it was crafted by a powerful wizard or entity who sought to manipulate life and death, and **Edwin**’s attunement to the orb puts him at risk of being influenced or controlled by its original creator. The party could eventually uncover the orb’s true purpose, possibly leading them to confront those who seek to claim it.
   - **Linked Powers**: The orb could hold latent abilities beyond what **Edwin** currently knows. As he delves deeper into its history, perhaps new abilities or effects reveal themselves, but only at great cost. The **[[Shadow Group]]** or other powerful factions may seek the orb for this very reason, knowing its true power has yet to be fully unlocked.

### 3. **Developing the Orb’s Powers**
   - **Upgrades and Additional Abilities**: As **Edwin** grows more attuned to the **[[Orb of Eternity]]**, additional abilities could be unlocked. These could include:
     - **Enhanced Damage Negation**: As **Edwin** levels up, the orb’s damage negation could increase, or perhaps it gains the ability to negate different types of damage, such as magical damage or area-of-effect attacks.
     - **Empowered Shockwave**: At higher levels, the shockwave could expand in range or deal more damage, or perhaps the shockwave could knock enemies prone, stun them, or push them back.
     - **Time-Based Powers**: Given the orb’s connection to immortality and time, new abilities could involve manipulating time itself, such as slowing enemies within range, or allowing **Edwin** to briefly accelerate his own actions or movement.
   - **Corruption Mechanic**: The curse of the orb could slowly start to corrupt **Edwin**, especially if he uses its powers too frequently. As the orb draws on his life force, he might start to suffer memory loss, physical decay, or develop an increasing dependency on the orb. This could add a tragic element to his quest for immortality, where every use of the orb brings him closer to losing himself entirely.

### 4. **The Orb’s Role in the Campaign**
   - **Object of Desire**: The **[[Orb of Eternity]]** is a powerful artifact, and it’s clear that other factions, such as the **[[Shadow Group]]** or **[[House Shadowmire]]**, want to possess it. The orb could serve as a central plot device, with various groups hunting **Edwin** and his allies, leading to dangerous encounters and political intrigue.
   - **Ties to Ancient History**: Perhaps the orb is one of several powerful artifacts tied to an ancient civilization or forgotten magical order. **Edwin** and the party could uncover more of the orb’s history, leading them on quests to find related artifacts or decipher the true meaning behind the orb’s creation.
   - **Restoration of **[[House Ravenswood]]**: If **Edwin** manages to control the orb’s powers, it could serve as a tool to help him restore **[[House Ravenswood]]**. With its immense magical abilities, he could use it to influence others, rebuild his family’s legacy, or protect his newfound allies. However, the orb’s curse could also threaten to undo his efforts, forcing **Edwin** to choose between power and his personal redemption.

### 5. **Quests and Story Hooks**
   - **Breaking the Curse**: One of the party’s main objectives could be to find a way to fully lift the curse of the **[[Orb of Eternity]]**. This could lead to encounters with ancient scholars, powerful mages, or entities that have long sought control over the orb. The party might need to visit forgotten temples, delve into magical ruins, or face dangerous creatures that guard the secrets of the orb’s curse.
   - **Protecting the Orb**: With so many factions interested in the **[[Orb of Eternity]]**, the party may need to protect **Edwin** and the artifact from powerful enemies. Whether they are fending off mercenaries hired by **[[House Shadowmire]]** or outsmarting rival mages, the orb’s presence could draw constant danger.
   - **Unlocking the Orb’s True Power**: Over time, the party could find ways to unlock more of the orb’s potential, but doing so requires risky or morally ambiguous choices. For example, the orb might need to be charged by sacrificing powerful magical items or even living creatures, forcing **Edwin** and the party to grapple with difficult decisions.

### 6. **Potential Long-Term Arcs**
   - **Edwin’s Fate**: A long-term arc could focus on **Edwin’s** growing connection to the orb and the potential consequences of that bond. Will he gain the immortality he seeks, or will the orb slowly consume his soul? The party may have to decide whether to continue helping **Edwin** in his quest or intervene to save him from the orb’s corruption.
   - **The Orb as a Threat**: As the orb’s powers grow, it could become a significant threat not just to **Edwin**, but to the entire **[[Etral Kingdom]]**. Powerful factions, possibly including the **[[Shadow Group]]**, may attempt to seize the orb and use it to reshape the political or magical landscape of **[[Aosa]]**. The party could be drawn into a conflict over the orb that has far-reaching consequences.
