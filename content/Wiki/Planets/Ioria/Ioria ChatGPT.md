The **[[Etral Kingdom]]** originating from **[[Ioria]]** provides another exciting realm to expand upon. To help shape the world further, here are a few ideas, questions, and suggestions that could give more depth to **[[Ioria]]** and its impact on the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** in **[[Xylaria]]**.

### 1. **Environment and Geography of [[Ioria]]**
   - **Climate and Terrain**: What was **[[Ioria]]** like before **[[The Convergence]]**? Was it a lush, verdant world like **[[Exa]]**, or perhaps a more challenging environment, like the deserts of **[[Rak'dyn]]**? Knowing the natural landscape will help define the cultural and military strengths of the **[[Etral Kingdom]]**.
   - **Unique Features**: Were there any natural or magical phenomena on **[[Ioria]]** that shaped the kingdom’s culture? For example, are there enchanted forests, ancient mountain ranges, or unique magical elements like ley lines or mystical creatures native to **[[Ioria]]**?
   - **Planetary Influence**: How did **[[Ioria]]** influence the kingdom’s development? Was it rich in resources that the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** used for technological advancement, or was it a harsher world that led to a more warlike, resilient people?

### 2. **Culture of the [[Etral Kingdom]]**
   - **Values and Society**: The **[[Etral Kingdom]]** likely brought over cultural values from **[[Ioria]]** that define them on **[[Xylaria]]**. Are they known for militarism, strict governance, or a deep respect for ancient traditions? Given their enmity with the **[[Trisfir Kingdom]]**, do they prize conquest and expansion?
   - **Magical or Technological Progress**: Did **[[Ioria]]** have access to powerful magic, technology, or a blend of both? Perhaps they had unique methods of channeling magical energy that differed from the ley lines of **[[Exa]]**. These methods could have been adapted in **[[Xylaria]]** to enhance their kingdom’s power.
   - **Social Hierarchy**: What is the structure of the **[[Etral Kingdom]]**? Are they ruled by a monarchy, a council, or something more authoritarian? Their rigid societal structure could reflect the environment and values of **[[Ioria]]**, especially if they are an expansionist empire.

### 3. **Magic on Ioria**
   - **Unique Magical Elements**: While **[[Exa]]** has ley lines and **[[Rak'dyn]]** has magical crystals, does **[[Ioria]]** possess any unique magical elements? Perhaps it was home to powerful magical storms, enchanted creatures, or ancient relics tied to the kingdom’s magic. The party could explore these elements, either uncovering artifacts from **[[Ioria]]** or understanding how their magic differs from that of **[[Xylaria]]**.
   - **Interdimensional Magic**: If **[[Ioria]]** had its own magical infrastructure before **[[The Convergence]]**, how did it integrate with the new realms? This could lead to a storyline where the party has to navigate the differences between **Iorian** magic and the ley lines of **[[Xylaria]]**, potentially discovering conflicts or power imbalances caused by the different magical systems.

### 4. **History and Legacy of Ioria**
   - **Pre-[[Convergence]] History**: Before **[[The Convergence]]**, was the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** a dominant power on **[[Ioria]]**? Were there other rival nations or kingdoms they had to contend with, or was their rule uncontested? Understanding their past might inform their current political motivations, such as a desire to reclaim lost glory or reassert dominance on **[[Xylaria]]**.
   - **After **[[Convergence]]**: How did the kingdom adapt to its new surroundings on **[[Xylaria]]**? Was the transition smooth, or did they face setbacks from a lack of resources or cultural clashes? This could lead to stories of early conflicts with other realms, especially with the **[[Trisfir Kingdom]]**, as the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** fought to establish itself.

### 5. **Diplomatic Relations and Rivalries**
   - **Conflict with the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]**: The rivalry between the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** and the **[[Trisfir Kingdom]]** is an excellent source of tension. What is the root cause of their enmity? Is it over territory, resources, or ideological differences? The party could become involved in border disputes, espionage, or even battles between the two kingdoms.
   - **Allies and Rivals**: Apart from their conflict with the **[[Trisfir Kingdom]]**, who else are their allies and rivals? Are there secret alliances with other realms on **[[Aosa]]** that the party could uncover? If the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** is expansionist, they might be seeking allies to tip the balance of power in their favor.

### 6. **Geography and Ecology of [[Ioria]]**
   - **Fauna and Flora**: What types of creatures lived on **[[Ioria]]**? Were there dangerous beasts that the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** tamed for war or trade? Are there any species of plants or animals that the kingdom brought with them to **[[Xylaria]]**, or are there remnants of **[[Ioria]]**’s wildlife that have adapted to their new surroundings?
   - **Post-[[Convergence]] Ecology**: If the kingdom is in a new environment on **[[Xylaria]]**, how have the people of the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** adapted to the local flora and fauna? Perhaps they’ve domesticated certain creatures from **[[Xylaria]]** to serve in their armies or for transport, and the party could be tasked with dealing with these exotic animals.

### 7. **Potential Long-Term Campaign Ideas**
   - **Warfare with the **[[Trisfir Kingdom]]**: A long-term campaign could involve an escalating conflict between the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** and the **[[Trisfir Kingdom]]**. The party could act as spies, diplomats, or soldiers, navigating the political and military tensions between the two realms. The campaign could build towards a climactic battle or diplomatic summit that determines the fate of the region.
   - **Artifacts of [[Ioria]]**: Perhaps the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** is searching for powerful artifacts that were lost during **[[The Convergence]]**. The party could be hired to find these artifacts, unlocking ancient **Iorian** magic and potentially tipping the balance of power in the kingdom’s favor.
   - **Restoration of [[Ioria]]**: Some within the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** might seek to restore their former homeworld or reclaim lands lost during **[[The Convergence]]**. The party could get involved in quests to find remnants of **[[Ioria]]**, either on **[[Xylaria]]** or elsewhere, leading to potential interdimensional travel or the discovery of hidden realms.

### 8. **Religious or Philosophical Beliefs**
   - **Religion or Philosophy**: Did the **[[Etral Kingdom]]** bring over religious beliefs or philosophical ideals from **[[Ioria]]**? If they were devoutly religious, perhaps their gods are now silent, and the kingdom is dealing with a crisis of faith. Alternatively, they might follow a strict code of honor or conquest, shaping their military and political outlook. The party could become involved in religious or ideological quests tied to these beliefs.
