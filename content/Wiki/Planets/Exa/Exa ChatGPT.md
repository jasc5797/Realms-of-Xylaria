[[Exa]] seems to be a rich, diverse world with a strong magical infrastructure tied to ley lines, and this can fuel some very interesting long-term plotlines! Here's a breakdown of thoughts, questions, and story ideas related to the new information you've shared:

### 1. **Ley Lines and Magic**
   - The **ley lines** being the primary source of magical energy suggests that they play a crucial role in the lives of the people of **[[Exa]]**, especially for those who practice magic. Are there any notable areas where the ley lines converge, creating powerful magical nexuses similar to [[Sylmare]] on [[Xylaria]]? These places could be key points of interest for the party to explore.
   - **Magical Infusion**: Since ley lines provide energy to both objects and creatures, does this mean some creatures or races on [[Exa]] are naturally more attuned to magic? The party could encounter magical beasts, ancient ley-line guardians, or even humanoid races that have evolved with magical abilities tied to the ley lines.

### 2. **Lost Cultures and Races**
   - **[[The Convergence]]** likely left many parts of [[Exa]] unaccounted for when sections of the planet were transported to [[Xylaria]]. Are there legends or prophecies among the **[[Exan Elf]]** or other races about reuniting the lost pieces of **[[Exa]]**? The party might be drawn into a quest to explore fragmented remnants of [[Exa]] scattered across the multiverse or hidden within the ley lines themselves.
   - The different cultures (humans, dwarves, orcs, goblins, etc.) could offer rich backstories. Are there any notable rivalries, alliances, or ongoing tensions between these races? These dynamics could play a major role in shaping the political landscape both before and after **[[The Convergence]]**. The party could be tasked with uncovering hidden enclaves of these cultures or mediating between displaced races trying to reclaim their homelands.

### 3. **The Kingdom Before [[The Convergence]]**
   - The **[[Trisfir Kingdom]]** before [[The Convergence]] would have had to contend with the other major factions on [[Exa]]. What were the political dynamics like? Were there any notable wars, alliances, or events that shaped the kingdom before its shift to [[Xylaria]]?
   - Did the kingdom's move to [[Xylaria]] sever it from key resources or allies? This could open up quests involving the party trying to reconnect lost trade routes, restore magical links, or deal with ancient enemies from **[[Exa]]** re-emerging to reclaim their influence.

### 4. **Exploration and Mysteries**
   - Since **[[Exa]]** is covered in ley lines, it might be dotted with ancient structures or places of power built by older civilizations that harnessed the ley lines' magic. The party could explore ancient ruins, long-abandoned cities, or forgotten temples that are only now accessible thanks to the ley lines’ shifts during **[[The Convergence]]**.
   - **Magical Objects**: Since ley lines power magical objects, there could be ancient artifacts scattered across **[[Exa]]** and now within [[Xylaria]] that the party could seek. Some may still contain immense power, while others could be unstable or corrupted due to being cut off from their original source of magical energy.

### 5. **Magical Crisis**
   - Since ley lines play such a vital role, a potential **magical crisis** could make for a great long-term campaign arc. If the ley lines become disrupted—perhaps through natural causes, misuse, or enemy interference—the party could be tasked with preventing a catastrophic loss of magic across **[[Xylaria]]**. 
   - Alternatively, if certain factions within **[[Xylaria]]** learn how to harness the ley lines for their own gain, the balance of power could shift dangerously, sparking conflicts across the realms. The party could be drawn into stopping these factions from monopolizing magical energy.

### 6. **Cultural Exchanges and Conflicts**
   - Since **[[Exa]]** was home to many different races, were there any **notable cultural exchanges** between the **[[Exan Elf]]** and other peoples before [[The Convergence]]? Perhaps the elves had key trading or magical alliances with the dwarves or gnomes, which they are now trying to rekindle in the new world.
   - **Old Conflicts**: Rivalries between the elves and other races from **[[Exa]]** might have carried over to **[[Xylaria]]**. Are there remnants of these old feuds that still fester, possibly leading to renewed conflict in the present? The party could be drawn into uncovering the roots of these old disputes or preventing them from reigniting in a new era.

### 7. **Potential Long-Term Plot Ideas**
   - **Reconnecting with [[Exa]]**: A long-term goal could be to discover a way to reconnect with the remaining fragments of **[[Exa]]** that were left behind during **[[The Convergence]]**. This could involve ley-line magic, traveling through time or alternate dimensions, or piecing together ancient elven rituals to find lost lands.
   - **Ley Line Control**: A campaign could revolve around factions within **[[Xylaria]]** (or other continents) attempting to control the ley lines for their own ends. The party could act as protectors of the ley lines, uncovering mysteries tied to the magical infrastructure of the world and preventing misuse.
   - **Exan Artifacts**: Powerful magical artifacts from **[[Exa]]** could be lost or dormant within the ley lines, waiting for the party to discover them. These items could be key to unlocking greater mysteries or even restoring parts of **[[Exa]]**.

This background opens up so many possibilities for adventures tied to magical energy, political intrigue, and exploration. Let me know if you'd like to delve into any of these themes more deeply or if you'd like help developing quests or missions within [[Exa]]!
