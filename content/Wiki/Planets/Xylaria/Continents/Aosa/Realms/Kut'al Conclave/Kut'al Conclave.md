# Introduction

The [[Kut'al Conclave]] is a completely [[Rak'dynian Thri-kreen]] inhabited kingdom originally from the planet [[Rak'dyn]]. This realm is mostly covered in arid and dry expanses of land. Many parts of the land are covered in deserts. Large crystal formations grow out of the sands, glowing with dim blue light across the dunes.

The [[Rak'dynian Thri-kreen]] of the [[Kut'al Conclave]] rely on crystals that grow natural within their realm to harness magical energy as a power source for magical abilities. These crystals absorb the magic energy of the surrounding realm over time. The rate of absorption depends on the size of the crystal and the realm in which the crystal is in. A crystal will grow in size when full imbued with magical energy. This allows the breaking of larger crystals to act as seeds to grow more crystals. However, small enough shards of crystal will no longer be able to hold enough magical energy to grow, limiting its usefulness when pulverized. On top of this, the crystals have only been shown to grow while at least partially rooted in the sands of the [[Kut'al Conclave]]. Sometimes the crystals will shatter when power flows to quickly into or out of the gem. Generally, the resulting shards will be too small to regrow.

The realm of the [[Kut'al Conclave]] has a relative low abundance of magical energy, so the crystals can take a long time to charge. This severely limits  capabilities and uses of the crystals within the [[Kut'al Conclave]]. Historically, this fact has stifled the power and progression of the [[Kut'al Conclave]] when in comparison to other realms on [[Aosa]]. However, different effects can be achieved by charging these crystals within other realms, greatly improving their capabilities and uses. For instance, the high abundance of magical energy within the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] causes the crystals to charge and grow at a rapid pace and the resulting magical energy the crystals provide once charged can act as an extremely stable power source. Other noticeable effects, such as color, are apparent when charging crystals in different realms. For instance, the crystals charged in the [[Kut'al Conclave]] glow with a dim blue color, while those charged in the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] glow with a bright white-gold color. The use of the crystals charged in the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] is extremely potent in conjunction with the artifician abilities of the people of the [[Gearspark Dominion]].

The [[Kut'al Conclave]]'s people rely on magical runes to channel their magical abilities. They accomplish this by tracing the runes in the air around them leaving behind dim blue symbols as they form their spell. These magical runes use the same symbols as the [[Kut'al Conclave]]'s alphabet. The brightness and sometimes the color of the runes can affected by the source of the magical energy being provided to fuel the magic. Most [[Kut'al Conclave]] spellcasters carry bits of crystal to serve as renewable power sources for their magical abilities. Mechanically these are flavored as spell slots when used. The crystals can grow and split overtime, explaining how higher level spell casting is achieved and how more spell slots are achieved. 

These runes can also be carved directly into stone for both enchantment effects and a way to route magical energy through artifacts.
