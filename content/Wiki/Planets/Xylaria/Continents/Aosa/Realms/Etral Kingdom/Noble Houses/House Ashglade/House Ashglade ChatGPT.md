The story of **[[House Ashglade]]** presents a rich backdrop for political intrigue, personal drama, and possible player involvement in both high society and more personal quests. The conflict with **[[House Shadowmire]]** and the flight of **[[Miera Ashglade]]** opens up many storytelling opportunities. Here are some ideas and potential questions to deepen the lore and develop possible quests:

### 1. **House Ashglade's Decline**
   - **Fallen from Grace**: **[[House Ashglade]]** was once prosperous, known for its agricultural wealth. What led to their decline? Was it due to poor management, natural disasters, or sabotage by rival houses such as **[[House Shadowmire]]**? The party could investigate whether **House Ashglade's** fall was accidental or part of a larger plot to force them into a desperate marriage.
   - **The Land and Crops**: Since **House Ashglade** was once known for its bountiful harvests, what has happened to their land? Has it become barren, or perhaps there’s a magical curse on the crops? The party could be involved in solving this mystery, helping **House Ashglade** regain its former glory by revitalizing the land, discovering the source of the problem, or even battling magical threats affecting the region.

### 2. **Miera Ashglade's Flight**
   - **Miera’s Disappearance**: **[[Miera Ashglade]]**'s decision to run away presents an opportunity for quests revolving around tracking her down, either to protect her or to bring her back to the family. Has **Miera** gone into hiding, or is she trying to find a new life away from her family’s expectations? Perhaps she’s joined a rebellious group or sought refuge in a distant part of the **[[Etral Kingdom]]**.
   - **Reasons for Flight**: What were **Miera’s** true reasons for running? Was she simply unwilling to marry **[[Vasher Shadowmire]]**, or did she discover something darker about the marriage arrangement or **House Shadowmire** itself? The party could be hired to protect her from bounty hunters or even to discover what hidden secrets **Miera** may know that put her life in danger.
   - **Adventure Potential**: **Miera Ashglade** could also be seeking a way to restore her family's fortunes through her own means. Maybe she is searching for a forgotten heirloom, a legendary artifact, or a long-lost magical technique tied to the family’s agricultural heritage. The party could join her on this quest.

### 3. **Vasher Shadowmire and House Shadowmire**
   - **Vasher Shadowmire**: Described as "notoriously sleazy," **[[Vasher Shadowmire]]** seems like a character who may have ulterior motives. Is he simply looking for a marriage of convenience to improve his house’s fortunes, or does he have darker ambitions? Perhaps he wants control of **[[House Ashglade]]**’s land for nefarious purposes, or he’s involved in a plot to consolidate power within the **[[Etral Kingdom]]**. The party might uncover his schemes and be forced to choose sides.
   - **House Shadowmire’s Power**: **[[House Shadowmire]]** seems like a scheming noble family. How powerful are they within the **[[Etral Kingdom]]**? Do they have rivals, and are there factions within the house that oppose **Vasher’s** marriage plot? The party could become involved in noble intrigue, perhaps serving as spies or negotiating on behalf of another house that wishes to disrupt the marriage arrangement.
   - **Shadowy Activities**: Given the name **"Shadowmire,"** the house could have a reputation for underhanded dealings, including blackmail, espionage, or even dark magic. The party might be hired to investigate **House Shadowmire’s** operations or sabotage their plans.

### 4. **House Ashglade's Future**
   - **Restoring House Ashglade**: The party could be directly involved in saving **[[House Ashglade]]** from bankruptcy. Perhaps they are hired by the house to solve the agricultural crisis, recover lost fortunes, or thwart **[[House Shadowmire]]’s** attempts to seize their land. Restoring the house’s wealth could involve recovering ancient magic tied to the land, negotiating trade deals, or preventing sabotage from rival houses.
   - **Rebuilding the House’s Reputation**: Beyond financial recovery, **House Ashglade** might need to repair its social standing. The party could help by exposing rivals’ corruption, securing alliances with other noble families, or even discovering and protecting **House Ashglade**’s historical legacy.

### 5. **Noble Politics and Intrigue**
   - **Marriage as a Political Tool**: The forced marriage between **Miera Ashglade** and **Vasher Shadowmire** represents the way political marriages are used to consolidate power within the **[[Etral Kingdom]]**. The party could be involved in a series of quests revolving around noble marriages, rivalries, and alliances, with each house vying for dominance. These alliances could impact the larger geopolitical situation of the kingdom, including its relations with other realms.
   - **Internal Conflicts**: Perhaps **[[House Ashglade]]** is divided internally. While **[[Miera Ashglade]]** fled, there may be other family members who support the marriage to **[[Vasher Shadowmire]]** as a means of survival. The party could be hired to mediate between these family factions or take sides in a growing feud.

### 6. **Magical and Historical Elements**
   - **Cursed Lands**: If **House Ashglade**’s agricultural downfall is tied to something more supernatural, there could be an ancient curse on the family’s lands, placed either by a rival house or tied to some long-forgotten misdeed. The party could investigate the curse, uncovering dark family secrets or ancient magic tied to the region’s fertility.
   - **Ancestral Relics**: **House Ashglade** might have lost important relics over the years—artifacts that could restore their fortunes or grant them protection against **House Shadowmire**. The party could be tasked with recovering these relics from dangerous locations or rivals.

### 7. **Potential Quests and Story Hooks**
   - **The Search for Miera**: The party is hired by **[[House Ashglade]]** or even by **[[House Shadowmire]]** to find **[[Miera Ashglade]]**, whether to protect her or bring her back. The search for **Miera** could take the party across the **[[Etral Kingdom]]**, uncovering secrets and dangerous factions along the way.
   - **Sabotage of House Shadowmire**: The party could be recruited by those who oppose the marriage to **[[Vasher Shadowmire]]**. They might need to sabotage **House Shadowmire’s** plans, uncover blackmail material, or prevent the marriage from being finalized. Alternatively, they could be asked to help **Miera** escape her fate.
   - **Restoring the Land**: The party is tasked with discovering why **House Ashglade’s** once-fertile lands have become barren. This could lead to a quest involving ancient magic, lost technology, or even dangerous creatures that are affecting the soil. 
   - **Stopping the Marriage**: If the marriage is close to taking place, the party might be involved in a race against time to stop it, uncovering last-minute evidence of **Vasher’s** treachery or helping **Miera** make a dramatic escape.

### 8. **Potential Long-Term Campaign Ideas**
   - **Restoring House Ashglade**: A long-term campaign could revolve around the restoration of **House Ashglade** to its former glory. The party might be responsible for re-establishing its agricultural dominance, forging alliances with other noble houses, and dealing with political intrigue. Along the way, they could face constant opposition from **[[House Shadowmire]]** and other rival houses.
   - **Uncovering House Shadowmire’s Secrets**: **House Shadowmire** might be involved in far more sinister activities than just political scheming. The party could uncover dark secrets—perhaps involving illegal trade, forbidden magic, or connections to dangerous entities—that lead to a larger plot that threatens not just **House Ashglade**, but the entire **[[Etral Kingdom]]**.
