# Introduction

[[House Ashglade]] is a nearly destitute noble house in the [[Etral Kingdom]]. This house was once known for its bountiful harvests, but in recent generations have fallen into many pitfalls that have hindered there agricultural efforts severely. To avoid complete bankruptcy [[Miera Ashglade]]'s hand in marriage has been offered to [[Vasher Shadowmire]], the notoriously sleezy heir apparent of [[House Shadowmire]], who has struggled to find a suitable marriage partner for many years. A clause of the marriage would sign all of the property of [[House Ashglade]] to [[House Shadowmire]] and all but guarantee [[Vasher Shadowmire]]'s rise to the head of his house someday. However, about a year ago [[Miera Ashglade]] decides to run away before the marriage can commence.
