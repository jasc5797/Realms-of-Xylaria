# Introduction

The [[Great Tribal Council]] acts as a major branch of the government of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]], serving as a balancing force against [[Asina Trisfir]], the [[High Chieftess]] of the kingdom. This is accomplished through a bi-directional system of checks and balances to make sure the interests of the kingdom are protected. Traditionally the [[Great Tribal Council]] is comprised of representatives from each of the [[Clans of Trisfir]], typically the heads of the clan. However, after reform laws passed over many generations, select groups of major influence, such as guilds and merchants, have been allowed entry of representatives into the council. ^introduction
