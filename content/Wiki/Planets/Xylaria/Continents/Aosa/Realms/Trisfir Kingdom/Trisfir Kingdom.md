# Culture and Society

## Demographic

The current day [[Trisfir Kingdom]] is predominately inhabited by elves, but pockets of other races do exist within its borders. Prior to [[The Convergence]] the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] was from the planet [[Exa]]. At the time [[Exa]] was comprised of many different races such as elves, humans, dwarves, gnomes, halflings, tieflings, orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, etc. However, during its time on [[Exa]] the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] kept tight borders, and allowed few of other races to enter. Due to this, [[The Convergence]] resulted in the majority of the populace of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] to be of elven descent. Although some enclaves of other races can still be found here even today, their ancestors having happened to be within the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]'s bounds during [[The Convergence]].

It is not unusual to see the likes of [[Rak'dynian Thri-kreen]] and [[Tinker Gnome|Tinker Gnomes]] within the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] as well. These races having traveled from the realms of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]'s allies: the [[Kut'al Conclave]] and the [[Gearspark Dominion]] respectively. Although few, the [[Rak'dynian Thri-kreen]] are more prominent in the rural areas of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. Here they enjoy the nature and simpler lifestyle these areas provide. On the other hand the [[Tinker Gnome|Tinker Gnomes]] and their creations, the [[Autognome|Autognomes]] are known to congregate in the larger, more developed cities of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]], such as [[Sylmare]]. These places provide near endless amounts of work for the [[Tinker Gnome|Tinker Gnomes]] as they begin to progress into an industrial age.
## Culture

The [[Trisfir Kingdom]] is heavily steeped in druidic and tribal influences with strong ties to nature. They seek to strike a balance of nature with their modern amenities that magical advancements have provided.
## Government

The [[Trisfir Kingdom]] is ruled over by a constitutional monarchy, comprising of a royal family, headed by [[Asina Trisfir]], and a council representing the [[Clans of Trisfir]] as well as other groups of major influence, like trade guilds and merchants.

The [[Clans of Trisfir]] control the most power among the council, but do not necessarily always have aligning interests. Initially the clans were the only ones allowed on the council, but within the past 100 years or so, they have elected to allow influential guilds and merchant groups to have seats on the council. The [[Clans of Trisfir]] each have ties to different industries, but the guilds and the merchant halls represent the interest of the common people in their respective fields. 

Each of the clans controls a domain within the bounds of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]].

# Magic

The powers of [[Exa]] are still apparent while within the bounds of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. Magical ley lines cross the planet and provide magical energy to the land. Some of these ley lines are still active within the bounds of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] on [[Xylaria]] as well. The ley lines are partial visible in the sky with a naked eye, and can be easier to see at night or when the observer is imbued with magical energy. The [[Trisfir Kingdom]] is reliant on the readily available power of these ley lines for their magical abilities and artifacts.

The capital city of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]], [[Sylmare]], is the convergence point between all of the ley lines available within the realms borders. This causes the area to provide any even larger source of power to its inhabitant.

The magic system of [[Exa]] is relatively similar to the standard magic system of DND 5e source books. However, the inhabitants of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] tend to lean towards druidic style magic. Any magic related to nature is emphasized here, mirroring the priorities of the people. On top of this, ones proximity to the ley lines can enhance magical abilities. This effect is especially prominent in [[Sylmare]] where the ley lines converge.

# History

## Before [[The Convergence]]

On the planet [[Exa]] the land that would eventually become [[Trisfir Kingdom]] was inhabited by many different warring elven clans. Eventually all of the disparate elven clans were conquered or forcefully persuaded to join into a unified kingdom by the ruthless clan leader of the Trisfir clan. This was done in an effort to protect the elven clans from the approaching kingdoms of other races. Eventually the elders of these were allowed to rule their respective lands under the ultimate control of the Trisfir clan. These elders were the ancestors of many of the clans in present day [[Trisfir Kingdom]].

# Geography and Ecology

The [[Trisfir Kingdom]] is considered to be among the most hospitable of all the realms within [[Xylaria]]. It is well known for its naturally temperate climate and mild weather. Topographically the land of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] is relatively smooth. While there are areas with hills and mountains, the land is relatively unmarred. These things have allowed [[Trisfir Kingdom]] to become an agricultural powerhouse on [[Aosa]].

The immediate area around [[Sylmare]] is covered in dense forests of red wood trees.
