# Description

Nestled behind [[Wobblesproket's Wonders]] within the heart of the merchant district of Sylmare, [[Runes of the Forge]] is a striking shop that radiates both primal power and skilled craftsmanship. The entrance is framed by dark wooden beams entwined with vines, with a sign hanging overhead bearing the shop’s name carved in intricate runes. The building itself is a blend of natural stone and metal, adorned with softly glowing blue runes that hint at the enchanting work of the [[Kut'al Conclave]] done inside.

Upon entering, customers are greeted by the rhythmic clang of a hammer striking metal, a sound that reverberates through the air with a faint magical hum. The shop is filled with a variety of weapons, shields, and armor, all displayed with precision. Each item bears runic inscriptions, some shimmering with arcane energy. The walls are lined with shelves holding rune stones, scrolls, and materials needed for custom enchantments. The center of the space is taken up by a large courtyard that is open to the outside through the second floor and is enclosed by sliding dark wooden doors. The inside of the courtyard if filled by a pristine [sand garden](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=442ff8e4c6d9f12b&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS995US995&sxsrf=ADLYWII6zin5vU21DKmzh01LNSnL1d9ykw:1724595360252&q=japanese+sand+garden&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J03RPjGV0MznOJ6Likin94oGSh4l60tfPppA0C5BN3BoPIPZ4mO02288TWcC6nhc953r-iEY0Fnsc8p63NNuEo-_9lE3vw8_wlWQTOUoJiOaz96h-0idQ3ri-YSm1XM5OrXkpWcQFBioEOqIgZo9k77XCAGMfHUETSSqA9Acuma1rt2NRw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjh4dCuqpCIAxUqpIkEHe5eIuwQtKgLegQIERAB&biw=1920&bih=945&dpr=1#vhid=DSq_9SX_bMj66M&vssid=mosaic) that is lined with many flowering planets. Crystals glowing with a bright white-gold color are embedded within the sands of the garden.

At the center of the shop stands [[Chak-tha]], a tall and imposing Thri-kreen with four strong arms, each equipped with tools of the trade. His chitinous exoskeleton reflects the light of the forge, while his compound eyes observe customers with an analytical focus. [[Chak-tha]]’s primary tool, a large hammer inscribed with powerful runes, rests by his side, ready to imbue items with magical properties.


- [[Chak-tha]], like many [[Thri-kreen]] from the [[Kut'al Conclave]], is rather stoic
- [[Chak-tha]] can make custom enchanted items at a marked up cost
- [[Chak-tha]] can also enchant existing magical items, however this process is much harder and comes with a heavy cost
