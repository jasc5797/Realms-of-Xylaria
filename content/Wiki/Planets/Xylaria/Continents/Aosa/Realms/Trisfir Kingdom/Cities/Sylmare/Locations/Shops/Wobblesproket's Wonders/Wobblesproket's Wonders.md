# Wobblesprocket's Wonders

**Location:** Merchant District, Sylmare

**Description:**  
Wobblesprocket's Wonders is an elongated two-story stone building nestled within the bustling merchant district of Sylmare. The shop's facade is a vibrant tapestry of blooming flowers, with flower boxes crammed into every available space, from the ground out front to the windows, where they hang precariously. The floral display is lovingly maintained by Boltz, an Autognome with a literal and metaphorical green thumb.



## Shopkeeper

**Horatio Wobblesprocket III:**  
An energetic and eccentric Tinker Gnome, Horatio is the mastermind behind the unique and steampunk-esque magical items found in his shop. He’s known for his rapid-fire speech, boundless enthusiasm, and a tendency to ramble about his creations. 

**Boltz:**  
Horatio’s Autognome assistant, Boltz, was originally designed to help with the shop’s operations. However, Boltz’s love for gardening often takes precedence, much to Horatio’s frustration. Boltz’s green thumb is a source of pride, and the Autognome spends more time tending to the flowers around the shop than assisting with Horatio’s projects.

## Notable Projects

### The Automated Stone Door
At the center of the shop is Horatio’s latest project—a large stone door and frame covered in gears and glowing runes. The door is connected to a massive glowing crystal, designed to slide open automatically when approached. Unfortunately, the demonstration often goes awry, with the door grinding open slowly and noisily. Horatio’s attempts to speed it up usually result in the door flying off its hinges, smashing into nearby shelves. Boltz, rather than helping, prefers to water the flowers.

## Items for Sale
