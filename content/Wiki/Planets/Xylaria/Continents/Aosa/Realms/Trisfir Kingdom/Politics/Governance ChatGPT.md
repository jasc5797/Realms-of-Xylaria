The government structure you've described for your elven kingdom is a complex system that blends elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and elements of a parliamentary structure, with significant checks and balances between different branches of power. Here are a few terms that could accurately describe this governance model:

### 1. **Aristocratic Constitutional Monarchy**

- **Aristocratic**: The governance system involves significant participation and influence from noble houses, who hold power in the form of an Assembly (Noble Conclave).
- **Constitutional Monarchy**: The High Sovereign (Monarch) is a ceremonial head with defined executive powers, which are regulated by constitutional laws, traditions, and checks from the Council of Elders and the Assembly of Noble Houses.

### 2. **Noble Oligarchy with Monarchical Elements**

- **Noble Oligarchy**: An oligarchy refers to a power structure where a small number of elite individuals or families (in this case, noble houses) hold significant power. The noble houses participate in governance through the Noble Conclave, where they influence legislation and state affairs.
- **Monarchical Elements**: The presence of a Monarch who performs ceremonial duties and has a defined executive role reflects the monarchical aspect of the governance structure.

### 3. **Feudal Parliamentary Monarchy**

- **Feudal**: This term refers to the division of the kingdom into provinces and territories, each governed by noble houses with a feudal-like relationship with the Monarch.
- **Parliamentary**: The Assembly of Noble Houses acts similarly to a parliament, engaging in legislation, resource allocation, and overseeing the kingdom's administration.
- **Monarchy**: The Monarchical presence in the form of a High Sovereign who retains executive control.

### 4. **Monarchic Republic with Aristocratic Oversight**

- **Monarchic Republic**: This reflects a government where the Monarch is a constitutional head, and governance involves elements of a republic, with elected representatives and governance bodies.
- **Aristocratic Oversight**: The noble houses exercise significant influence through their coalition, balancing power between the Monarch and the aristocracy.

### 5. **Aristocratic Monarchy with a Conclave System**

- **Aristocratic Monarchy**: The government structure emphasizes the role of aristocracy (noble houses) in governance, while the Monarch retains an executive position.
- **Conclave System**: The use of a conclave or assembly system, where decisions are made collectively by representatives from noble houses, ensuring shared governance.

### 6. **Hereditary Monarchy with an Aristocratic Senate**

- **Hereditary Monarchy**: The leadership of the kingdom is based on hereditary succession, with a ruling Monarch and a royal family.
- **Aristocratic Senate**: The Assembly of Noble Houses functions similarly to a senate, where noble representatives debate and decide on legislative matters, providing a check on the Monarch's powers.

### Key Characteristics of the Government

To better understand how this governance system works, here are some key characteristics and examples that illustrate its unique blend of monarchical and aristocratic elements:

- **Checks and Balances**: The Monarch's powers are checked by the Council of Elders and the Assembly of Noble Houses. This prevents absolute rule and ensures that the government reflects the collective will of the kingdom.
- **Factions and Alliances**: The existence of different factions (e.g., the Council of Stars and the Council of Trees) within the Assembly leads to shifting alliances and political dynamics, creating opportunities for intrigue and role-playing.
- **Local Governance**: Provinces and territories are governed by noble houses or appointed stewards, reflecting a feudal system with local governance.
- **Judicial Oversight**: The High Court of the Elven Realms ensures legal oversight, interpreting laws and maintaining justice across the kingdom.
- **Cultural and Spiritual Influence**: Institutions like the Temple of the Ancestral Grove and the Arcane Conclave reflect the importance of culture, spirituality, and magic in elven society, influencing governance indirectly.

### Real-World Analogies

Here are some real-world analogies that can help frame this governance structure:

- **United Kingdom**: A constitutional monarchy where the Monarch has ceremonial duties, and the government is run by a parliament and a coalition of political parties. Similarly, the High Sovereign works alongside the Noble Conclave.
- **Holy Roman Empire**: A complex political structure where power was shared between an Emperor and various princes, dukes, and bishops, akin to the coalition of noble houses and the Monarch in your campaign.
- **Ancient Rome (Pre-Empire)**: The Roman Republic had a Senate and popular assemblies that held legislative power, akin to the Assembly of Noble Houses and the Council of Elders.

### Fantasy Inspirations

To draw further inspiration from fantasy worlds, consider these examples:

- **Rivendell (from J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth)**: An elven realm where councils, led by Elrond, involve discussions and decision-making with representatives from various factions.
- **Elder Scrolls' Summerset Isles**: The Aldmeri Dominion features a governance system with a ruling monarch and significant involvement from noble families and magical councils.
- **Dragon Age's Orlais**: A feudal society with a ruling emperor and noble houses involved in political maneuvering and power dynamics.

### Conclusion

The governance structure you've developed is a sophisticated blend of various governmental principles, reflecting the rich cultural heritage of the elves. Naming it something like **"Aristocratic Constitutional Monarchy"** or **"Noble Oligarchy with Monarchical Elements"** captures its essence and complexity, providing a strong foundation for political intrigue and storytelling in your campaign.
