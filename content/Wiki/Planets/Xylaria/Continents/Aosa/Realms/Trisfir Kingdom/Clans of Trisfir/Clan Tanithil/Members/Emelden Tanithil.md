# Description

A sloppy half elf who appears to be middle aged. He has a bit of a beer belly and his cloths are a little stained. He is from an offshoot branch of the main part of [[Clan Tanithil]].
# History

[[Emelden Tanithil]] was a steward in [[Clan Tanithil|Clan Tanithil's]] mercantile company. He acted as a manager of sorts for the party of [[Edwin Ravenswood]], [[Gnutz Snatcher]], [[John-Boy Blackthorne]], and [[Miera Ashglade]]. On the day of the [[Festival of the Moon]] he had assigned the party to transfer a wagon up the main street of the city right before the parade. However, once the wagon was placed in an alley off of the main street it exploded near the head of the parade. [^1]

Later, after the party had been exonerated they infiltrated the warehouse where [[Emelden Tanithil|Emelden Tanithil's]] office was. Here they confronted [[Emelden Tanithil]] about his involvement in the explosion. He pleaded with the party saying that he was not the mastermind  behind the plot and was instead just a lackey who did not ask too many questions if the pay was good. He did let slip to the party that his cousin, [[Zukar Tanithil]], was the one who setup this deal in the first place. Before he can tell the party anymore he is shot in the chest by an assassin in red armor. [^2]
