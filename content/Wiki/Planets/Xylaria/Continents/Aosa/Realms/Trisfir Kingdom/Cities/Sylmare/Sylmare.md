# Introduction

 [[Sylmare]] is a sprawling city carved directly into the ancient ruins of a petrified giant redwood tree stump. It is situated slightly off the coast of the main land of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. Here it resides within a natural bay that provides shelter on all but one side. In the distant past, the stump fell victim to some large scale explosion that is believed to have been beyond the capabilities of anyone today. This explosion caused the top surface of the stump to be hollowed out, leaving a concave center with raised edges. The explosion appears to have hit the stump on the side that was farthest inland, causing the edges facing then open ocean to be raised higher than all of the others. The roots of the stump also serve many purposes, such as bridges to the mainland and as docks. These roots have been carved out and expanded as needed to accommodate their uses. ^introduction

# Locations
## City

The city sprawl encompasses the roughly 10 mile diameter of the top side of the stump. Much of the inside of the stump has been hollowed out to be used for additional space within the city as well. Through natural processes and careful cultivate local flora and fauna have been incorporated directly into the city architecture. This provides a stunning contrast between the greenery and stone carved buildings of all shapes and sizes throughout the city. The palace of [[Clan Trisfir]] is situated at the highest peak of the edge of the stump facing the open ocean. It is mostly comprised of multiple spires carved to look covered in vine, and like most of the city mixes much greenery within the architecture. 

## Outpost

The rest of the severed tree lies out to sea and is also petrified. The log and it's branches create natural breaks that help to quell major storms and bad waves coming into the bay. Only the bottom end of the log, closest to the stump, emerges from the water a few miles out into the ocean. The exposed area of the log is only a few miles square. The top of this land mass is made up of the ragged bottom edge of the log, and causes a step topography that is rimmed at the apex by a jagged arc. The remainder of the log sinks rapidly into the deeper part of the ocean and into the sea bed. An outpost is situated here that servers as a military complex to protect the bay. This island also contains a light house that uses crystals filled with energy to produce bright light. The output is not nearly as developed as the main city on the stump.

# Demographic

Like most places in the [[Trisfir Kingdom]], [[Sylmare]] is predominantly made up of [[Exan Elf|Elves]]. However, [[Sylmare]] does tend to consist of a larger mix of other races due to it being a major trading port.
