The [[Trisfir Kingdom]] is ruled over by a constitutional monarchy, comprising of a royal family and a council representing the noble houses of the kingdom as well as other groups of major influence, like trade guilds and merchants.

The noble houses control the most power among the council, but do not necessarily align. Initially the noble houses were the only ones allowed on the council, but within the past 100 years or so, they have elected to allow large enough guilds and merchant groups to have a seat on the council. The noble houses each have ties to different industries, but the guilds and the merchant halls represent the interest of the common people in their respective fields. 

Each noble house controls a domain within the bounds of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]].
