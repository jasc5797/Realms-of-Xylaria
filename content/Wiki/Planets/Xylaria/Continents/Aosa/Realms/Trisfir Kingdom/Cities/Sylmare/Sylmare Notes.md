# Notes

- The area must've been covered in water at some point for a long time to become petrified, but maybe some sort of magic caused the process to be quicker. Whether this magic process is from the tree or outside of it, or both is yet to be determined. This damage should play into the late game of the story
- This tree could possibly be revived as a plot point or left the way it is as a background story thing
- The city is an ideal port for trading in all areas, and the ruling kingdom is quite wealthy. This affords them lavish areas of the city, the are kept pristine. Including a large police/guard force to maintain constant control. Even still there must be an underbelly to the city that can hide in the deeper parts of the tree trunk. Think mines of Moria on the inside 
- Class system based on location in tree. The upper and more outer portions are affluent but the inner portions could be more hellish like cyberpunk 
- Noble houses and Royal family struggle for power using political maneuvering
