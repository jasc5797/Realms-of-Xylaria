This note gives a great, detailed look into the [[Gearspark Dominion]]! There's a lot of potential here for longer-term missions and intricate political and cultural dynamics. Here are some follow-up questions and thoughts to help solidify storylines:

1. **Culture and Society**:
   - Do you have any specific ideas about the internal **government** of the [[Gearspark Dominion]]? Is it run by a council of gnome inventors, or is there a monarch or technocratic leader overseeing all development? The structure here could create both internal tensions and rivalries that the party could get involved with.
   - **Demographic**: While primarily [[Tinker Gnome]]-inhabited, do any other races or factions coexist or visit the Dominion? This could add diversity to the missions or social interactions.
   - **Societal Balance**: Is there tension between those who value more traditional, refined artificing and the more impulsive inventors? This could lead to quests involving feuding inventors or "fixing" failed experiments gone awry.

2. **Magic and Technology**:
   - The **erratic nature** of their magic has rich story potential. Are there laws in place to regulate risky inventions, or is chaos embraced as a form of progress? It might be interesting to involve the party in trying to recover or repair artifacts that have malfunctioned, or mitigate disasters that arise from unstable magic.
   - The **orange crystals** from the [[Kut'al Conclave]] seem like a powerful resource. Are they difficult to obtain or process? There might be missions around securing them or dealing with smugglers. Also, what kind of balance of power do these crystals provide the [[Gearspark Dominion]] in their diplomatic relations?

3. **Diplomatic Relations**:
   - **Allies**: Both the [[Kut'al Conclave]] and the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] appear to be key trade partners for resources and power. Are there any formal agreements or potential rivalries between these allies? Perhaps the party could be tasked with securing or negotiating more favorable terms.
   - **Enemies**: What’s the source of conflict with the [[Etral Kingdom]]? Is it resource competition, political differences, or past conflicts? This could lead to larger-scale missions, espionage, or even full-scale warfare.

4. **Geography and Ecology**:
   - Any notable landscapes, hidden cities, or hazardous regions in the [[Gearspark Dominion]]? Is it fully industrialized, or are there wilderness areas with unique fauna? Some details here could inspire exploration-based missions or environmental challenges.

5. **Before/After [[The Convergence]]**:
   - **Before the Convergence**: How did the [[Gearspark Dominion]] function or thrive before [[The Convergence]]? Were there different alliances or technologies lost to time?
   - **After the Convergence**: The effects of [[The Convergence]] are still a bit unclear—did it bring about a merging of worlds, or shift the [[Gearspark Dominion]] into a new reality? Understanding this would help in weaving the event into future arcs.

With all these details, the **long-term goals** for the party could range from resolving diplomatic disputes, protecting or recovering powerful artifacts, to solving crises caused by failed inventions. Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these ideas in more depth!
