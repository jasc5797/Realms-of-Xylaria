# Magic

The denizens of the [[Gearspark Dominion]] are known for their artifician abilities, specifically for crafting artifacts and constructs. Their handwork can be recognized by its distinct steampunk mechanical appearance. It tends to be made of a bronze like metal with plenty of whirring parts and gears, sometimes to an excessive amount. While the artificers do make some of the most powerful artifacts and constructs on [[Aosa]], they are equally liable to impulsively attempt to make any idea they have into a reality. This causes an abundance of half baked and hairbrained artifacts floating around the realm.

Some of the most powerful artifacts crafted by the [[Gearspark Dominion]] have come about by building them using crystals from the [[Kut'al Conclave]] that have been charged within the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. 

Like the magic from [[Cognair Prime]], the magic within the [[Gearspark Dominion]] is very erratic in nature, leading to many disasters over years. Crystals from the [[Kut'al Conclave]] glow with a vibrant orange color that is constantly changing in brightness and saturation.

They are also well known for their ability to manufacture mechanical simulacrum known as [[Autognome|Autognomes]].
