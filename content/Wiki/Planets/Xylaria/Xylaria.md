## Introduction

[[Xylaria]] is a planet comprised of an amalgamation of lands taken from different planets from across the multiverse. Over a thousand years ago an event, known as [[The Convergence]], transported each of these fractured lands to [[Xylaria]]. During the transportation, each of these lands, known as realms, were perfectly cut to align to their boarding realms. This caused the forming of larger land masses as well as vast oceans across the surface of the planet. While the direct source of [[The Convergence]] is unclear, its influences are not. Something on [[Xylaria]] causes the pre-existing conditions from the original planets, such as magic and climate, to continue while within the boundaries of each realm. This causes visually distinct boundaries where each of these realms collide. ^introduction
