# Description
The [[Rak'dynian Thri-kreen]] of the [[Kut'al Conclave]] are a race that thrives in desert and arid climates, preferring the harsh environments that mirror their stoic nature. They originate from the planet [[Rak'dyn]]. While not religious, they possess a strong druidic connection, which fosters their relationship with the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. Their expressions are difficult for outsiders to read, and their unique body language often leads to misunderstandings with other races. The Thri-kreen view other races as too rash and overbearing in both political and social situations, valuing a more measured approach. This has led to a natural affinity with [[Autognome|Autognomes]], whose subdued nature and clinical rationality they deeply appreciate.
