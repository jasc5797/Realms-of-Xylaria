# Religion

Each realm comes with its own religions, but it is a mixed bag on whether their populaces still believe. Magics that are more closely tied to their gods described any further are described as being flat, clouded, or otherwise seeming like a simulacrum/lifeless/soulless in comparison to before [[The Convergence]].

Barring extraneous circumstances magic tied to any religion works across all of the other realms as normal.
