*[[OzaisLetter.webp|Letter from Ozai]]*

# Description

This letter was found on [[Gnutz Snatcher]]'s bed in the parties homebase after returning from interrogating [[Emelden Tanithil]] at the warehouse. The letter bares Ozai''s sigil, a burst of flame, pressed into the wax seal. Upon opening a small gout of flame appears to emanate from the letter, however this effect is illusory in nature. The letter contains a message from [[Ozai]] to [[Gnutz Snatcher]].

## Contents

> To my trusted Gnutz,
> 
> It brings me great pride to witness your transformation from the frightened cub I took in after the flames of your village consumed everything, to the powerful and cunning force you’ve become within the Veilbound Syndicate. In just a few short months, you’ve carved your own path, making connections in Sylmare that many only dream of—high places, indeed. This will serve us both well, and I look forward to the rewards we shall reap together.
> 
> Although I am not quite sure how you managed it, your discovery of Clan Tanithil's involvement in the destruction of your home does not go unnoticed. Take the time you need to settle this personal matter—avenge your clan as you see fit. Your enemies are mine, after all, and I trust you will channel your rage into something useful for our cause.
> 
> I will be in contact soon. Once your foothold in Sylmare is more secure, I’ll have some more... delicate tasks that require your particular talents.
> 
> Until then, keep sharp. There’s much more to gain.
> 
> - *Ozai*
