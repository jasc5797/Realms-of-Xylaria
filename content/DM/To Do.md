## Player Characters
- [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] assassination of a cleric
- [[Gnutz Snatcher]] letter from [[Ozai]]
- [[Miera Ashglade]] encounter with thugs from [[House Shadowmire]]
	- Maybe [[Elvi Zunil]] or [[Isvar Zunil]] can warn her that some thugs have been looking for here around [[Sylmare]]
- [[Edwin Ravenswood]] needs some sort of event too. Maybe something that will trigger the transformation of [[Edwin Ravenswood]] into his older self. May want to check with Billy beforehand

## Tech Debt

- Have Quartz start from a different directory so when this is loaded the vault name isn't "content"
- Look into Trello replacement
	- https://github.com/roovo/obsidian-card-board
	- https://publish.obsidian.md/kanban/Obsidian+Kanban+Plugin
- Update GitHub readme to be related to [[Realms of Xylaria]] instead of [[Quartz]]
	- Make sure this has a link to the [GitHub Pages](https://jasc5797.github.io/Realms-of-Xylaria/)
- Fix the meta image that is used when this link is shared over text so that it is related to [[Realms of Xylaria]] instead of [[Quartz]]
	- Use [[UnknownLetter.png]] for this
