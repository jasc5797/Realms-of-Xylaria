### Backstory

Gnutz Snatcher was born into a quiet bugbear village, a life far removed from the dangers of the wider world. His idyllic childhood was shattered when a coalition of elves and humans launched a surprise attack on his village. Terrorized by the overwhelming force, Gnutz fled into the dense woods, leaving behind his home, family, and everything he knew.

Alone and frightened, he wandered for days until he was found by a shadowy figure - a powerful crime overlord with a keen eye for talent. Recognizing the potential in the young bugbear, the overlord took Gnutz under their wing, training him in the art of thievery and survival.

Under the overlord's tutelage, Gnutz transformed from a scared child into a hardened criminal. He learned to pick locks, move silently, and blend into the shadows. His once innocent mind became sharp and calculating, as he mastered the gritty realities of the underworld.

Over the years, Gnutz has worked countless jobs for his overlord, from stealing priceless artifacts to infiltrating heavily guarded strongholds. While he has grown accustomed to his life of crime, the memories of his destroyed home and lost family never truly fade. A deep-seated anger and longing for revenge against elves and humans continues to burn within him, fueling his ambition and driving his actions.

**Possible Character Hooks:**

- Gnutz could have a hidden talent for tracking or survival due to his upbringing in the woods.
- He might have a phobia of fire or open spaces due to the trauma of the village attack.

- A chance encounter with a survivor of the attack could stir old emotions and force him to confront his past.

This background provides a rich tapestry of experiences and motivations for Gnutz Snatcher, making him a complex and compelling character.
