This is ideas for a kingdom that could be the home of Billy and Jared's characters. It doesn't have to necessarily be a completely human Kingdom and/or they could be close allies with a kingdom of a predominantly different race.

Billy's and Jared's characters are involved with one of the human kingdom's crown jewels, the magic academy. This academy and human ingenuity keeps the human Kingdom in contention for power of [[Aosa]]. 

This Kingdom could be antagonistic and warlike especially towards [[Trisfir Kingdom]] and it's allies. The government also has deep ties to the shadow government. The academy is similarly tainted.

Billy's character is thrown out for getting to close to discovering the shadow group and is forced to defect to [[Trisfir Kingdom]]

Jared's character's family is tied to the shadow group but her involvement was either non-existent or extremely limited. This could be the cause in the divide with her and her family. She is similarly on the run and joins with Billy's character seeking safe haven in [[Sylmare]]. One of the characters should have a contact and/or lead in the city that is what prompts their travel there.


# Rough idea

Jared's character is from a failing house on the rural part of the [[Etral Kingdom]]. She flees and steals a family heirloom as she tries to escape the sleeze ball noble she was supposed to marry. This marriage caused all of her property to become his property. So now he is hunting her for the heirloom. Eventually she makes it to the capital of the [[Etral Kingdom]] in order to find work. She is hired to bring a magical item to Billy's character for him to ascertain its abilities. Billy's character is currently working at the magic academy with some prestige which is how he gets tasked with investigating the item. While Billy's character investigates the item it causes a magical effect to cause him to revert to his younger self. This make him forget everything that has happened to him passed that younger age. In a panic he escaped the academy. At some point Jared's character returns to retrieve the item from the academy but hears the Billy's character ran away with it. She tries to track him down and eventually does. However they are quickly attacked by goons from the shadow group and are forced to flee the city. During their exchange with the goons it should be revealed they were actually after both of their items.

Billy's younger self swears that he knows some one in [[Sylmare]] who can help them figure out more about his condition and maybe the items themselves. [[Sylmare]] is nothing like Billy's younger self remembers, and the person they were looking for turned out to have died a long time ago. With not many options they eventually begin doing contract work for [[Clan Tanithil]] as a way to earn money while looking into other avenues of investigation
