# Description

This item is a one handed gauntlet made up of many layers of folded metals of different colors.

This item has a large metal(?) spike/fang/stinger on a hinge with a locking mechanism. The spike can be locked in the open or closed position.

*Hinge options*
- The spike/fang/stinger lays flat or tip down into the palm of the bearer, and the base of it is attached to a locking hinge at the palm. When unlocked the spike/fang/stinger angles out at a shallow angle slightly away from the bearers palm. The bearer can smash or grab a target to spear them with the spike/fang/stinger. In this configuration the unlocking mechanism is strong enough to stab a target if the bearer already is resting their hand on the target
- Assassin's creed style over the hand or under
- Spike/fang/stinger is facing down towards the underhand and can be extend to allow for an underhanded stab


# `Abilities`

This item holds charges for different Ability Scores and Spell Slots. The item can hold up to 20 of each type of Ability Score and up to 20 charges of Spell Slots. 

As an action the wielder can unlock the spike/fang/stinger and use it to make a melee attack against a creature. The weapon counts as a light and versatile. On a successful hit the weapon does XdY piercing damage, and the the creature must make a saving through of the bearers choose. On a failed save that creature's stat of the bearers choose is drained by 1d4(?) and the item generates that many charges of that stat type. Alternatively the bearer can choose to drain a spell slot from the creature instead. In this case the target creature must make a save corresponding to their spell casting ability. The 1d4 roll will drain a spell slot of that level or the next highest level of that creature does not have a high enough spell slot. This creature will restore their Ability Scores to normal upon the next dawn. Spell Slots are regenerated normally.

As a bonus action the bearer can expend any number of charges of a single type per turn to boost their own Ability Scores or expend Spell Slot charges to cast a spell they already know of a matching level and of a spell level the bearer can cast. (Should the Ability Score improvement last longer? Until the end of your next turn)

If the item still has at least 10 charges in each stat and spell slots or a combined total of 70 charges across all types, then as a bonus action the bearer can choose to expend all available chargers within the item. This will grant the bearer X amount of turns with all of their base stats to 20 (unless that stat is already above 20) and the ability to cast any of their spells without expending any of their own spells lots. X will scale based on the amount of charges in the item when this ability is activated. This ability can only be used once each day and refreshes at dawn. Once this ability runs out the bearer must make a 1d4 roll and on the roll of a 1 the item is broken beyond repair.

Notes:
- maybe can't steal spell slots from non casters
- maybe can't steal charges above the target creatures max ability score or spell slot.
