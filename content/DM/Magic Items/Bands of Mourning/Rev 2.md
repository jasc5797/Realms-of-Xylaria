# Legendary Item
*Requires Attunement*

## Description
This one-handed gauntlet is crafted from layers of folded metals of varying colors. It features a large metal spike, fang, or stinger on a hinge with a locking mechanism, allowing it to be deployed in different configurations.

### Hinge Options:
- **Palm Position:** The spike can lay flat or extend tip-down into the bearer's palm, angled slightly away when unlocked. This allows the bearer to smash or stab a target.
- **Underhand Style:** Similar to an Assassin's Creed blade, the spike faces downward and extends for underhanded attacks.

## Abilities
This item can hold charges for Ability Scores and Spell Slots, each up to 20.

**Melee Attack:** As an action, unlock the spike to make a melee attack. The weapon counts as light and versatile. On a hit, it deals XdY piercing damage. The creature then makes a saving throw (DC determined by the bearer's choice of Ability Score). On a failed save, the creature's chosen Ability Score is drained by 1d4, and the item gains that many charges of that type. Alternatively, the bearer can drain a spell slot from the creature, requiring a save corresponding to the creature's spellcasting ability.

**Bonus Action Benefits:** As a bonus action, the bearer can expend charges to boost their own Ability Scores or use Spell Slot charges to cast spells of a matching level. Ability Score boosts last until the end of the bearer's next turn.

**Empowered State:** If the item has at least 10 charges in each type (Ability Scores and Spell Slots) or a total of 70 charges, the bearer can, as a bonus action, expend all charges to enter an empowered state. This state lasts X turns (X scales with the charges expended) and sets all of the bearer's base Ability Scores to 20 (if not already higher), allowing them to cast spells without expending their own Spell Slots. This ability refreshes at dawn but risks breaking the item beyond repair on a roll of 1 on a 1d4 after it expires.

*Note: Adjust XdY damage and saving throw DCs based on the item's intended power level and the bearer's level in the campaign.*
