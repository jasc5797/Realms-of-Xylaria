Item. Uncommon
This stick resembles any other stick you might find
the ground. As an action, you may stick this stick to a
solid object. It will remain in the same place
and orientation until you use an action to remove it. The Stick
of Sticking can only stick to once surface at
a time, and it will detach if subjected to more than 2
pounds of pressure.
If broken into pieces, these new smaller sticks retain
the same magical effect.
