Start them out already working for a repudiated noble or royal. Give them a starting base that is slightly above there means. Have an attack on the city happen relatively early on to close of traffic in and out of the city

 The party inadvertently helps the noble house plant explosives that decorate during the festival. Other explosives were placed as well. The royal was hurt but not killed. Or is this too much to start out with
 If they are captured they are imprisoned and through torture and zone of truth they are proven innocent. They Royal family decides to hire the party on as a similar sort of contractor to their previous employment. They will get to keep the house and also are given a generous stipend for their troubles. They mostly deal with the keeper of the house, whom is secretly the royal spy master. He is mischievous and shouldn't be taken at face value, which he plays off things with a rye hummer. He will take a liking to the party if things go well.
Otherwise the party can try to escape by somehow besting the guards blocking the ways in and out of the city or by find an escape route through the seedy underground or sewers
