## Act 1

A cult like entity and/or shadow government similar to [[The Set]] from [[Mistborn Era 2]] has formed in [[Aosa]]. They have tendrils in many high places across the whole continent. They orchestrated the bombing attack on the [[Royal House]] that the party gets involved with. Afterwards, the party should get contracted by the [[Royal House]], and will either investigate or stumble into the real perpetrators. 


After some time exploring [[Aosa]], the party will have a major confrontation with shadow group. Maybe in the north like in [[Critical Role Campaign 2]]. This should be a difficult fight that could incur loses in the party. In the end the shadow government is able to escape, but leaves behind clues as to what they are trying to accomplish. It seems like they are after ancient magical artifacts and have spent a long time researching the effects of the magic that binds each of the realms to [[Xylaria]].

The party does not get much home to lick there wounds as flying ships from a previously uncontacted continent arrive on [[Aosa]]


## Act 2

Other civilizations have also been progressing on the other continents of [[Xylaria]] over the years. Now they have arrive with full force on [[Aosa]] using flying ships. Reflavor the ships from [[Spelljammer]] for this. I think it makes sense for them to be hostile/antagonistic. War would be either first and foremost or an inevitability. Having the outsiders of [[Aosa]] out competing in trade could also be a plot point here or later. This would be an excuse for them to get there own ship and explore the other continents.

Ending the war and/or chasing the shadow group should be the end of this act. This should how the party gets the final clues about what the shadow group is trying to to do. They are trying to reverse the magic used to summon each of the realms and return them to their original planets. Likely the specifics of how this could be done or what the ramifications are would elude the party here but there would be hints.

## Act 3


The idea for the convergence is like [[Obduction]]. Something summoned each realm to [[Xylaria]] as their land and/or planet was being destroyed. The shadow group either does not know or does not believe that the home planets have been destroyed. The validity of these claims can be dubious to the party to help build tension. At some point the players or a player should get a vision or something similar that expresses this through some sort of connection with the magic of [[Xylaria]]. This should be some sort of entity/force, but its etherealness/eldritchness should be flushed out later. Likely there should be an opposing entity/force that was responsible for destroying all the home planets.

The players will have a final confrontation with the shadow group and decide to stop them, help them, or even stop them and go through with the split anyways.

Ideally the party stops the shadow group and does not split the planets. Maybe those on [[Xylaria]] are stuck in a time pocket. So if they all return to their home planets they witness the destruction of the planets like in [[Obduction]]. Otherwise this could also explain how the bad entity/force hasn't found them yet.

## Finale

Either as a later one shot or a small arc, the party could face off against the entity and hopefully stop it for good. If successful then I could see two endings. In the first ending the home planets have all been destroyed so they all remain on [[Xylaria]]. The second ending is through some time manipulation they are able to stop the bad entity/force before he ever destroyed any of the home planets. Time is altered and it's as if [[Xylaria]] never existed. Instead somehow a similar person to each player character exists in this time line. And the civilizations of each planet has found ways or have been granted ways by the good entity/force to travel between each world. This could be already a thing or just becoming a thing in the epilogue. I'm leaning towards the first ending, but ending two could be good. The second ending is similar to [[The Dark Tower]] which I like.

## Misc
- At some point the power of [[Sylmare]] could be restored as a weapon. This could be good against the bad entity/force
