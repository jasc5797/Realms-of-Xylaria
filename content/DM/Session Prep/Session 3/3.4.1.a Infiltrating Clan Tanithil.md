# Notes

## ChatGPT

- **Mission Brief:** A noble sympathetic to the [[Shadow Group]] has been funneling resources and wealth into the criminal network. Isvar wants the party to break into their manor to retrieve important documents proving the noble's connection to the [[Shadow Group]] and the [[Clan Tanithil]]. This will expose the noble's treachery and disrupt the [[Shadow Group]]'s political influence.
- **Encounters:** Traps, elite guards, a rival party hired by the noble to protect the house.
- **Plot Hook:** The stolen documents mention a deal between the noble and a mysterious figure operating in the lighthouse outpost.

## My Notes

- Preferably the party chooses to tackle this first before [[3.4.1.b Tracking down the Cultists]] as that mission is a little easier to reuse later
- This would be the house where [[Zukar Tanithil]] stays. 
- [[Zukar Tanithil]] is closer to the top of [[Clan Tanithil]] then the bottom. Meaning he has lived a privileged life style, but is not directly involved in controlling the clan\

### Session Overview: Infiltrating Zukar Tanithil’s Manor

The party has been tasked with infiltrating the manor of [[Zukar Tanithil]], a suspicious and dangerous figure. The manor is located in an upscale district of [[Sylmare]], protected by Clan Tanithil’s guards, magical wards, and Zukar’s personal paranoia.

**Objectives:**

1. Infiltrate Zukar’s manor without being detected (or minimize detection).
2. Gather incriminating information or intelligence on [[Zukar Tanithil]].
3. Escape safely, avoiding capture or alerting Clan Tanithil.

---

### Key Areas of the Manor

1. **The Outer Grounds**
    
    - A sprawling garden surrounds the manor, complete with tall, spiked fences and patrolling guards.
    - **Guards**: 2 guards walking the perimeter in pairs, each pass takes 5 minutes.
        - Use passive Perception (13) or a DC 12 Stealth check to slip past unnoticed.
        - **Alternative Option**: If a guard is charmed or bribed, they may offer a route through a hidden side gate (DC 14 Persuasion or DC 12 Deception).
    - **Obstacles**:
        - Magical traps on the gates (Glyphs of Warding, DC 15 Arcana to detect, DC 16 Sleight of Hand to disable).
        - The garden’s hedge maze can be used as cover (DC 13 Investigation to find an optimal path, with advantage on Stealth checks).
2. **The Servant’s Entrance (Back Door)**
    
    - Less guarded, but Zukar employs a vigilant, suspicious head of servants, [[Narvea Tanithil]], who is fiercely loyal to the family.
        - **Narvea**: Insight +5, passive Perception 14. If the party engages her, she’ll suspect intruders unless persuaded or disguised (DC 16 Deception or DC 14 Persuasion).
    - **Disguises**: If the party has gathered uniforms (perhaps from bribing or incapacitating guards), they can pose as servants (Disguise kit, DC 13) to enter unnoticed.
3. **The Main Hall**
    
    - A grandiose hall with sweeping staircases, chandeliers, and patrolling enchanted suits of armor (animated armor).
        - **Armor Sentinels**: They patrol slowly, scanning for intruders (DC 14 Stealth to evade). If triggered, they will alarm the guards in the manor.
    - **Social Dynamics**: Clan Tanithil occasionally holds gatherings here. If the players timed their infiltration during an event, they could blend in (DC 15 Deception or Performance checks).
4. **Zukar's Study (2nd Floor)**
    
    - This is Zukar's private chamber where he keeps his most sensitive documents. The room is locked with a **Arcane Lock** (DC 18 Thieves' Tools or DC 16 Arcana to disable).
    - **Traps**:
        - **Glyph of Warding (Fire)** on the door handle (DC 16 Perception to detect, DC 17 Sleight of Hand to disable).
        - **Alarm Spell** triggered by opening the window from outside (unless disarmed, DC 17 Investigation to notice and DC 15 Arcana to dispel).
    - **Clues & Items**: The study contains:
        - **A ledger** listing suspicious dealings and under-the-table bribes that connect Zukar to various criminal activities.
        - **Encrypted Letters** from a cult-like group he is working with (connected to the [[Order of the Pale Hand]]). These require a DC 18 Intelligence check to decipher.
        - **A magical item**: a ring of mind shielding that Zukar uses to keep secrets hidden from magical interrogation.
5. **The Guest Rooms (3rd Floor)**
    
    - These are currently unoccupied but are being prepared for high-ranking members of Clan Tanithil. Guards here are minimal, but some rooms have spying devices (Arcane Eyes) or hidden agents.
        - **Arcane Eyes**: These floating orbs (Invisible) scan the halls and chambers (DC 17 Perception to notice and DC 15 Stealth to avoid detection).
        - **Hidden Guards**: Two elite Tanithil guards (AC 17, HP 60) are stationed here, but will not attack unless they are directly provoked or alerted.
    - **Alternative Interactions**: The party might find letters, clothing, or minor magical trinkets that provide more insight into Clan Tanithil’s operations.

### Challenges and Encounters

1. **Skill Challenges** (Stealth and Intrigue):
    
    - **Guards’ Patrol Routes**: Have the players make a series of stealth checks as they traverse the manor. DC increases the deeper they go: DC 13 in the gardens, DC 15 in the hallways, and DC 17 near Zukar’s study.
    - **Servants and Social Challenges**: If disguised, the players may need to roleplay through interactions with servants or guests. If they fail, they could be interrogated by the head servant or a suspicious guest (Contested Charisma checks).
    - **Magical Defenses**: Use Arcana and Investigation challenges to disable traps or counter magical wards.
2. **Combat Encounters** (if stealth fails):
    
    - **Manor Guards**: Elite guards (Veterans or Knights, depending on party level). If alerted, reinforcements arrive in 1d4 rounds.
    - **Animated Armor**: These sentinels can be used as a security system. If a fight breaks out, they will engage the party, giving guards time to react.
    - **Arcane Eyes**: If the party is spotted by an Arcane Eye, it immediately alerts Zukar, who sends reinforcements.
3. **Zukar Tanithil Encounter**:
    
    - If the players reach Zukar’s chambers without alerting him, they could catch him off guard.
    - **Zukar Tanithil** (a cunning mastermind, likely a Bard or Warlock) may not engage the party in direct combat but rather seek to escape or manipulate the situation:
        - **Phase 1**: Zukar tries to deceive the party with charm spells and negotiation (suggestion, charm person), offering to buy their silence or frame another member of the [[Clan Tanithil]].
        - **Phase 2**: If combat is inevitable, he uses his mobility spells (misty step, dimension door) to try to evade the party, all while calling for reinforcements.

---

### Event-Based Mechanic: **Timer for Escalation**

As the session progresses, implement a **clock mechanic** to represent the gradual increase in difficulty as time passes in the manor.

- **Clock Segments (4 segments, 30-minute intervals):**
    - **First Segment**: Guards remain on normal patrol, defenses are standard.
    - **Second Segment**: Zukar’s personal guards become more vigilant; increased patrols (DCs increase by 1).
    - **Third Segment**: Magical wards begin to shift, and Zukar is informed something is off. Players must make higher stealth or deception checks (DCs increase by 2).
    - **Fourth Segment**: Full alert. Zukar is preparing to flee or fight. All guards are aware of an intrusion.

The longer the party takes, the more challenging the infiltration becomes, encouraging them to be efficient and decisive.

---

### Complications & Twists

1. **Unforeseen Guests**: A rival house within the [[Tanithil Clan]] may also be there, forcing the party into tense political negotiations. They may have conflicting goals with the party but could also be valuable allies in this mission.
    
2. **Secret Passage**: The party may uncover a hidden passage beneath the manor leading to Zukar’s private vault, where even more incriminating information or treasures may be found. However, it may also serve as Zukar’s escape route, complicating matters.
    
3. **Double-Cross**: At a key moment, one of the party's contacts (perhaps an inside agent in the Tanithil clan) could betray them, attempting to sell them out to Zukar for a higher favor. How the party deals with this twist could greatly influence their success.

### Rewards and Conclusion

1. **Incriminating Evidence**: The players retrieve documents or objects that expose Zukar’s illicit dealings or cult involvement.
	-  Hidden ledger that documents Zukar's funneling of [[Clan Tanithil]]'s resources into the [[Order of the Pale Hand]]. At a glance the ledger only details locations, items, gold, deliveries, etc. [[Isvar Zunil]] maybe able to gather more information. However there seems to be a common thread [[Beacon's Watch]]
	- [[3.4.2 Mission Reward]]
1. **Magical Loot**: Depending on their thoroughness, the party may find magical items in Zukar’s manor, such as enchanted weapons, rings, or scrolls.
2. **Plot Hooks**: The players could uncover Zukar’s involvement with more sinister plots, leading to future missions involving the [[Order of the Pale Hand]] or escalating conflicts with the [[Clan Tanithil]].

### Possible Next Steps

- If Zukar escapes or survives, he becomes a recurring villain, using his influence to sabotage the party.
- If the party gathers enough intel, they can launch a more significant blow against Clan Tanithil or expose Zukar’s cult ties.
