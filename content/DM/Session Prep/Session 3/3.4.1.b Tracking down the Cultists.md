- **Mission Brief:** Isvar suspects that the [[Clan Tanithil]] warehouse was just the surface of a larger criminal network. He has received intel suggesting that the [[Shadow Group]] uses the underground sections of [[Sylmare]] to conduct more secretive operations. The party is tasked with exploring the old, carved-out caverns beneath the city, now a dangerous hub of illicit activity. They need to find out what the [[Shadow Group]] is hiding down there.
- **Encounters:** Criminal gangs, rogue sorcerers, and possibly aberrant creatures lurking in the forgotten tunnels.
- **Plot Hook:** The underground investigation reveals a series of smuggling routes that lead to the lighthouse outpost near [[Sylmare]], hinting at larger operations.

## My Notes

- Preferably the party chooses to tackle [[3.4.1.a Infiltrating Clan Tanithil]] first as this plan maybe easier to reuse later. 
- [[Elvi Zunil]] has agents in place to take the cultist by surprise in one of their safe locations
- These agents could do the job on their own or with the help of the party
- The agents can continue to track the cultists which will allow for extra time for the party to complete other tasks first
- It may be preferable that the agents wait to tail the cultists as they go other places

# ChatGPT Plan

### Session Overview: **Cultist Hunt in the Underground**

**Location**: The vast underground network beneath [[Sylmare]], specifically a rough-hewn area that the cult has repurposed into a hideout/safehouse.

**Objectives**:

1. Navigate the labyrinth of tunnels with the help of [[Elvi Zunil]]'s agents.
2. Track the cultists to their safehouse and confront them in battle.
3. Investigate the area, finding magical equipment and uncovering clues about cult activities at [[Beacon's Watch]].

---

### Key NPCs

- **[[Elvi Zunil]]'s Agents**: Silent, efficient trackers who act as guides, helping the party navigate the underground maze. They provide minimal combat assistance but offer key intel and scouting.
- **Cultist Leader**: A mid-ranking cultist in the [[Order of the Pale Hand]], in charge of overseeing cult operations in the underground. The leader will flee or fight depending on the party’s approach.
- **Cult Miners**: The cultists are using magical mining equipment to unearth something of value, likely connected to their dark rituals.

---

### Part 1: Entering the Underground & Navigating the Maze

#### Scene Setup:

The session begins with the party meeting with [[Elvi Zunil]]'s agents, who have tracked the cultists to a remote section of the underground tunnels. The area is dimly lit by enchanted lamps or glowing crystals embedded in the walls, giving the place an eerie, ancient vibe.

- **Mechanics**:
    - **Maze of Tunnels**: The agents provide a rough map, but the underground is vast and easy to get lost in. Every few minutes, the party must make a group skill check to avoid getting turned around.
        - **Survival (DC 14)** or **Perception (DC 15)**: Success means they stay on track. Failure results in the party wandering into a side passage (potential ambush or traps).
        - **Complication**: If the party fails multiple navigation checks, have them run into hazards or other underground dwellers (carrion crawlers, giant spiders, or animated mining equipment).
- **Hazards & Challenges**:
    - **Shifting Tunnels**: Part of the underground is unstable, with occasional tremors. Players must make **Dexterity saving throws (DC 12)** to avoid loose stones and falling debris.
    - **Ancient Runes**: Some passages are marked with old magical wards left by previous inhabitants (long-forgotten mages or dwarves). Detecting these traps requires a **DC 14 Arcana check**, and disarming them requires a **DC 15 Thieves’ Tools** or **Arcana** check.

#### Agent Assistance:

- The agents inform the party that the cultists have retreated to a "rough-hewn" section of the underground, where they’ve been mining with strange magical devices.
- If the party struggles, the agents suggest possible routes and provide advantage on one of the navigation skill checks.

---

### Part 2: Reaching the Cult Safehouse

#### Scene Setup:

After navigating the tunnels, the party reaches the cultist hideout. This area is more hastily carved than the surrounding tunnels, with jagged, rough walls and debris scattered across the floor. Arcane mining equipment hums in the background, and the air smells faintly of sulfur and dust.

- **Layout**:
    - **Main Chamber**: A large open space where cultists oversee operations. There are mining carts, arcane-powered drills, and glowing gemstones being extracted from the walls.
    - **Smaller Tunnels**: Branching off from the main chamber are smaller tunnels where cultists rest or work in secret.
    - **Escape Route**: A side passage leads deeper into the tunnels. If the cultists get a chance, they will try to flee in this direction.

#### Skill Checks Before Combat:

- **Stealth or Surprise**: If the party attempts to sneak in, they can make a group **Stealth check (DC 15)** to approach undetected. Failure results in the cultists spotting them, reducing the chance for a surprise attack.
- **Scouting**: An agent suggests sending one person ahead to scout the area (optional). A successful **Perception (DC 13)** check allows the scout to learn the cultist numbers and their positions, granting the party advantage on initiative.

---

### Part 3: The Battle Against the Cultists

#### Cultist Forces:

- **Cult Leader** (1): This mid-ranking cult leader oversees the operation and fights using dark magic and manipulation tactics.
    
    - **Stats**: Use a **Priest** stat block with some necromantic spells (e.g., _Inflict Wounds_, _Hold Person_, _Spiritual Weapon_ flavored as ghostly hands of the dead).
    - **Tactics**: The leader will prioritize staying in the back, buffing allies and using control spells. If threatened, they will attempt to flee through the escape route.
- **Cult Miners** (5): Fanatical cultists using the magical mining equipment and defending the operation.
    
    - **Stats**: Use **Cultist** stat blocks, but some have modified weapons (enchanted pickaxes and drills that deal 1d8 damage, with a chance to knock the target prone on a crit).
    - **Tactics**: Cultists will swarm the party, using the environment to their advantage (ducking behind mining carts or using drills for cover).
- **Magically Enchanted Mining Constructs** (2): Mining constructs are animated by the cultists for heavy labor. They’ve been repurposed for defense.
    
    - **Stats**: Use **Animated Armor** or **Golems** for these, with a few tweaks to give them mining-themed attacks (e.g., slam attacks with magical drills or crushing grips).
    - **Tactics**: These constructs will focus on frontline combat, pushing back intruders and guarding the cult leader.

#### Environmental Hazards:

- **Magical Mining Equipment**: The equipment scattered around the room is powered by arcane energy. If tampered with, it can become dangerous:
    - **Sabotage**: A player with proficiency in Arcana or Tinker's Tools can make a **DC 15 check** to overload a piece of equipment, causing it to explode. This deals **2d10 fire damage** to creatures within 10 feet.
    - **Falling Debris**: Due to the roughness of the area, failed **Dexterity saving throws (DC 12)** could result in falling rocks or equipment, dealing **1d6 bludgeoning damage** and creating difficult terrain.

---

### Part 4: After the Battle

#### Clues & Investigating the Safehouse:

Once the cultists are defeated, the party has the opportunity to investigate the safehouse.

- **Documents**: They find a bundle of encrypted letters, maps, and ledgers that detail cultist activity. A **DC 14 Investigation** check reveals references to [[Beacon's Watch]], suggesting the cult has plans for that location.
- **Magical Artifacts**: Among the mining equipment, the party finds strange magical artifacts, potentially related to the cult's dark rituals. These could be minor magical items or components (e.g., fragments of a ritual circle or gemstones used in necromantic magic).
    - **Identify/Arcana (DC 15)**: Reveals that these items are likely connected to a larger ritual, possibly tied to a place of power near the sea.

#### Next Step:

- **The Lead to Beacon's Watch**: The most important clue is a partially decoded message that reveals the cult's next move: a ritual at [[Beacon’s Watch]], a lighthouse on an island just off the coast. The message mentions something ominous happening under the cover of night, tied to the lighthouse’s light and the tides.

---

### Optional Complications & Twists

1. **Escaping Cult Leader**: If the cult leader escapes, they could be a recurring antagonist, gathering more cult forces for future confrontations. The party might find evidence of their escape in the form of a missing artifact or map.
    
2. **Ambush from Below**: As the party is about to leave, reinforcements arrive—a small group of cultists who were stationed in the deeper tunnels. This could lead to a desperate escape or a final showdown as the cultists try to stop them from reporting back.
    
3. **Elvi's Agents Return**: After the fight, one of [[Elvi Zunil]]’s agents returns, helping the party navigate out of the underground before more cultists arrive, ensuring a smooth extraction.
    

---

### Conclusion

With the clues in hand, the party now has a clear direction: they must investigate [[Beacon’s Watch]] and stop whatever ritual the cultists are planning. The magical equipment and artifacts suggest the cult’s plans involve necromantic or arcane energy tied to the island’s natural environment.
