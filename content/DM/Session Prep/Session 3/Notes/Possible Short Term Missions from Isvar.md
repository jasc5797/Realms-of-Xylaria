Here are a few follow-up missions that **Isvar** could assign to the party after they successfully infiltrate the [[Clan Tanithil]] warehouse. These missions introduce different regions of [[Sylmare]] and the surrounding [[Trisfir Kingdom]], while building on the story of the [[Shadow Group]].

### 1. **Underground Investigation in [[Sylmare]]**

- **Mission Brief:** Isvar suspects that the [[Clan Tanithil]] warehouse was just the surface of a larger criminal network. He has received intel suggesting that the [[Shadow Group]] uses the underground sections of [[Sylmare]] to conduct more secretive operations. The party is tasked with exploring the old, carved-out caverns beneath the city, now a dangerous hub of illicit activity. They need to find out what the [[Shadow Group]] is hiding down there.
- **Encounters:** Criminal gangs, rogue sorcerers, and possibly aberrant creatures lurking in the forgotten tunnels.
- **Plot Hook:** The underground investigation reveals a series of smuggling routes that lead to the lighthouse outpost near [[Sylmare]], hinting at larger operations.

### 2. **Heist at the [[Sylmare]] Noble's Manor**

- **Mission Brief:** A noble sympathetic to the [[Shadow Group]] has been funneling resources and wealth into the criminal network. Isvar wants the party to break into their manor to retrieve important documents proving the noble's connection to the [[Shadow Group]] and the [[Clan Tanithil]]. This will expose the noble's treachery and disrupt the [[Shadow Group]]'s political influence.
- **Encounters:** Traps, elite guards, a rival party hired by the noble to protect the house.
- **Plot Hook:** The stolen documents mention a deal between the noble and a mysterious figure operating in the lighthouse outpost.

### 3. **Outpost at Sea – The Lighthouse Mystery**

- **Mission Brief:** After discovering the smuggling routes or references to the outpost, Isvar sends the party to investigate the lighthouse out to sea near [[Sylmare]]. Rumors suggest it’s a meeting point for smugglers and pirates linked to the [[Shadow Group]]. The party must uncover what’s being smuggled and who’s behind it.
- **Encounters:** Pirates, sea monsters, and an ancient magical artifact hidden within the lighthouse that controls the tides.
- **Plot Hook:** The outpost is revealed to be a front for a larger operation involving forbidden magic. The artifact found within may hold secrets about the [[Shadow Group]]'s endgame.
- The cult could have a secret hideout under the lighthouse in an area known as the Beacon's Watch

### 4. **Tracking a [[Shadow Group]] Leader**

- **Mission Brief:** A key leader of the [[Shadow Group]] has been spotted in the outskirts of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. Isvar tasks the party with hunting them down, uncovering their plans, and possibly extracting crucial information about the group's next big move. This mission could take them to remote villages or hidden hideouts in the countryside.
- **Encounters:** Ambushes from mercenaries hired by the [[Shadow Group]], or magical traps set by the leader.
- **Plot Hook:** The leader drops hints about a much bigger plot involving political unrest in the [[Trisfir Kingdom]], which can expand the campaign scope.

### 5. **Sabotage the [[Clan Tanithil]] Operation**

- **Mission Brief:** After the infiltration of the warehouse, Isvar believes a more aggressive approach is necessary. He orders the party to sabotage another of [[Clan Tanithil]]'s major operations, possibly a shipment of dangerous contraband meant to fund the [[Shadow Group]]. The party must intercept or destroy this shipment before it reaches its destination.
- **Encounters:** Mercenaries, an elite mage, or rival factions vying for control of the contraband.
- **Plot Hook:** The contraband turns out to be something much more sinister than expected, like a weapon or magical device capable of causing mass destruction, further complicating the party’s decision-making.

These missions keep the party grounded in the immediate region of [[Sylmare]] and [[Trisfir Kingdom]] while introducing larger, world-building elements tied to the [[Shadow Group]]. The outpost lighthouse and underground sections serve as natural locations for exploration, while each mission can reveal new layers of the [[Shadow Group]]'s network.
