Reporting back to Isvar Zunil on their findings and the events at the warehouse could be a critical next step for the party. Considering Isvar’s role as the spymaster and his interest in using the party for delicate tasks, he would likely have arranged a secure and discreet way for them to contact him or his close associates.

### **Methods of Contacting Isvar**

1. **Dedicated Informant or Liaison**:
   - Isvar might assign a specific contact person who regularly checks in with the party. This could be a low-profile member of the Trisfir intelligence network who meets the party at predetermined locations or times to exchange information.
   - [[Isvar Zunil]] has a contact named [[Elvi Zunil]], his granddaughter, who can act as a liaison.
   - **Example**: *“Meet at the old mill on the riverbank every third night at sunset. Look for a man with a red scarf.”*

2. **Magical Communication**:
   - Given the magical resources at Isvar's disposal, he might provide the party with a magical item designed for secure communication, such as enchanted stones or amulets that allow for whispered conversations over distances (similar to *Sending Stones*).
   - **Example**: *“Use these stones to whisper your reports. Only my ears will hear your words.”*

3. **Secret Drop Points**:
   - For added security, Isvar could set up several covert drop points around the city where the party can leave messages, documents, or other items of interest. These would be regularly checked by Isvar’s agents.
   - **Example**: *“Leave your findings in the hollow of the third oak from the left in Marley Park. Change the drop if you ever feel it’s compromised.”*

4. **Direct Summons**:
   - If the matter is urgent or requires immediate attention, Isvar might have given the party a way to signal him or his closest advisors directly, perhaps through a special token or flare.
   - **Example**: *“If the matter presses, use this token at the city’s eastern gate. A guard there is one of mine and will know to fetch me posthaste.”*

### **Isvar’s Reaction to the Findings**

Upon receiving the report from the party, especially involving the Shadow Group, the murder of Emelden Tanithil, and the destruction of evidence through fire, Isvar’s actions would likely include:

1. **Internal Investigation**:
   - Isvar would initiate a quiet but thorough investigation within Clan Tanithil and other associated entities to root out any connections to the Shadow Group. This would be done discreetly to avoid tipping off other potential conspirators.

2. **Strategic Planning**:
   - Using the information gathered by the party, Isvar would adjust his strategic plans regarding the Shadow Group and how they interact with the city’s politics. This might involve shifting alliances or preparing for potential threats.

3. **Securing the Party’s Role**:
   - Recognizing the party’s effectiveness and now their deeper involvement, Isvar might increase their responsibilities, providing them with more resources or information to continue their investigations or to protect themselves against backlash from the Shadow Group.

4. **Information Leverage**:
   - Isvar would use any tangible evidence or leads obtained by the party to leverage his position in political discussions or secretive negotiations, strengthening his hand against rivals or enemies within and outside the kingdom.

5. **Protection and Secrecy**:
   - Given the dangerous nature of the information, Isvar would ensure that the party is protected from direct retaliation by the Shadow Group. He might relocate them or increase their security detail discreetly.

### **Follow-up Missions**
- Following the initial report and Isvar’s analysis, he might send the party on further missions to continue investigating the Shadow Group or to disrupt their operations, solidifying the party’s role as his unofficial operatives who can maneuver in ways the official guards cannot.

This setup not only deepens the party’s involvement in the city’s shadowy affairs but also enhances their relationship with Isvar, setting up a complex web of intrigue for your campaign.
