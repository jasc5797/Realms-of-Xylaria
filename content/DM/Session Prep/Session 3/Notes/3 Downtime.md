### Downtime Activities and Preparation

Downtime can be an excellent opportunity for the party to develop their characters, deepen storylines, and prepare for upcoming challenges. Here are some activities and minor tasks that Isvar might suggest or that the party could undertake on their own to make productive use of their downtime:

#### **1. Training and Skill Enhancement**
- **Skill Training**: Members could spend time training in specific skills that may be useful for future missions. For example, learning how to better disguise themselves, improve their lock-picking abilities, or even pick up some basics of a new language or code-breaking.
- **Weapon or Magic Practice**: Engage in practice sessions to improve combat tactics or experiment with new spells or magical items that Isvar has provided.

#### **2. Gathering Information**
- **Local Reconnaissance**: Visit taverns, markets, and other public places to gather rumors and information about the city's political climate or any strange happenings that could tie into their next mission.
- **Spy Network Interaction**: Isvar might encourage the party to establish or deepen contacts within the city’s underworld. This could involve meeting with informants, rescuing a spy in trouble, or blackmailing a small-time crook for information.

#### **3. Crafting and Resource Acquisition**
- **Crafting Magical Items or Potions**: If any party members have the appropriate skills, they could spend time crafting items that will aid in their next assignment.
- **Acquiring New Gear**: They could also spend time finding and purchasing new gear, perhaps funded by Isvar as part of their preparation.

#### **4. Personal Quests and Backstory Development**
- **Resolve Personal Matters**: Party members can take this time to address personal backstories or quests. For example, a character could investigate a mysterious letter from an unknown family member or delve into a personal rivalry.
- **Build Relationships**: Engage more deeply with each other or with NPCs to build relationships that might provide support or assistance in future campaigns.

#### **5. Scouting Future Locations**
- **Recon Missions**: Isvar could suggest that they do preliminary recon on a location that will be crucial in a future mission, like scoping out a guarded estate or a secret meeting place used by the Shadow Group.

#### **6. Strengthen Defenses**
- **Fortify Lodgings**: Given their involvement with Isvar and the dangerous entities they’re dealing with, the party might want to secure their lodgings against intrusion or spying.
- **Set Up Safe Houses**: They could establish or identify safe houses within the city, places where they can hide or recover if a mission goes poorly.

#### **7. Recreational and Social Activities**
- **Attend Social Events**: Attend a ball, festival, or gathering where they might casually gather intelligence or make influential contacts.
- **Leisure Activities**: Engage in activities that reduce stress and allow for character development, such as visiting a local theater, enjoying a feast at a renowned inn, or participating in a city-wide tournament.

#### **8. Pre-Mission Meetings**
- **Strategy Sessions with Isvar**: Have meetings with Isvar to discuss strategies and get detailed briefings about their next mission. This could involve learning about the target, understanding the stakes, and planning entry and exit strategies.

### Integration into the Campaign
Each of these activities not only provides depth to the narrative but also allows players to develop their characters in meaningful ways. This downtime can be used to set the stage for more intense and focused missions ahead, making the characters better prepared and more deeply connected to the story’s unfolding events.
