- The party decides to follow [[Steve]]'s advice and travel to [[Rollicker's Rampage]] in [[Sylmare]]'s underground to see if the barkeep, [[Bob]], knows anything more
- [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] leads the party through a lesser known area and through some hidden storm drains to enter a deeper part of the underground

## Bugbear's Den

- The barkeep is a bugbear by the name of Glarb who after some payment tells the party directions to [[Rollicker's Rampage]]
- They get around of Anything ale, a brew with quite a bit of popularity in the underground of [[Sylmare]]. It is reported to change colors
- [[Edwin Ravenswood]] attempts to play a game of five finger fillet in the back of the tavern and wagers 8 gold pieces. The other man ups the wager to 15 gold pieces total from each of them.

- The man tries to walk away with the pot saying that since its a draw "the house always wins"

- The man and most of his gang head outside leaving one scrawny looking lackey to watch the wagered gold. Once they gang is outside [[Gnutz Snatcher]] convinces the boy to leave and pockets the gold. 
- Meanwhile outside [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] takes aim at a bottle and is unsurprisingly to most able to shoot the bottle without the man being able to slash the bullet in half with his sword.
- The man is convinced the party must have cheated and refuses to pay out until [[Gnutz Snatcher]] is able to disarm him with a well placed arrow shot.
- The man and his lackeys leave with their tails between their legs, and drop any remaining coins they had on them
## [[Rollicker's Rampage]]

> Rollicker's Rampage is a rough-and-tumble underground fight club, where locals and travelers alike gather to witness thrilling brawls, place bets, and test their mettle. Located beneath the bustling city of Sylmare, the den has an old, carved-stone ambiance with flickering lanterns and the lingering scent of sweat, ale, and blood. The den is operated by a loose guild of fight enthusiasts and is well-known in the underbelly of Sylmare, though its location is only disclosed to those in the know. This is where Steve from The Thirsty Goat sends adventurers looking for thrills, coin, and information.
- The barkeep Bob offers the party a round of Anything ale
- He tells them if he was a beating man he would bet on the goliath blood hunter Lunamore
- Initially [[Edwin Ravenswood]] wants to bet on some of the fights, but the party learns that their is a no-holds barred party fight that they could enter. The only rule being that the fighting is to unconsciousness not death. 
- The party signs up for the fight as The Foot of Darkness

- The party asks Bob about the [[Pale Hand]]. He turns pale and ushers them into the backroom.

- He tells them that they can be identified with tattoos bearing the mark of the [[Pale Hand]].
- They do not show up in the bar often, but it has been more and more frequently recently. Especially recently after many of the [[Order of the Pale Hand]] went to ground after they were chased out of the upper city.
- Apparently one of the members of the [[Order of the Pale Hand]] had killed someone in a match at the [[Rollicker's Rampage]] in the past so they have all been barred from fighting
- Bob offers to keep an eye and ear out for any more activity he catches wind of from the [[Order of the Pale Hand]] in exchange for them coming back for at least one additional fight in the future.
- In the meantime he leaves the party in the private room with some food and drink to recuperate from their fight
- The party levels up!
