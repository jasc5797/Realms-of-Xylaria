### 1. Arrival on Protector's Point

- **Environment & Atmosphere**: As the party arrives on the island, describe the coastal fog, the distant glow of the magical lighthouse, and the sounds of activity from the military outpost and trading companies. There’s a constant flow of guards and traders, giving the place a tense but bustling feel.
- **Initial Encounters**: The guards on the island recognize the party from their prior assignments in Sylmare, offering casual information about unusual activity on the island, like recent property purchases, strange visitors, or supplies being transported to Beacon's Watch.

### 2. Beacon’s Watch District

- **Exploration**: Beacon's Watch is the main settlement on Protector's Point, housing docks, warehouses, a few residential buildings, and inns frequented by sailors. The district is slightly run-down, contrasting with the military outpost, and has a reputation for its taverns, attracting those with a penchant for secrecy.
- **Notable Locations**:
    - **Old Lighthouse Inn**: A popular spot for travelers and sailors, where locals might gossip. Some patrons have noticed strange shipments arriving late at night near the cult’s property.
    - **Market Square**: Limited stalls offer exotic wares and trinkets from overseas traders, some run by cult informants posing as merchants.
    - **Culthouse Property**: A modest, seemingly abandoned building tucked between warehouses. The property looks neglected, with overgrown weeds and locked doors.

### 3. Investigating the Cult's Property

- **Entering the Property**: The party might need to sneak or break in, as there are heavy locks and magical wards (e.g., wards that trigger minor illusions or alarms). Inside, they find signs of recent activity, such as lit candles, scribbled notes, and sacrificial symbols related to the Order of the Pale Hand.
- **Evidence and Clues**:
    - **Ancient Tomes and Maps**: Notes about rituals to call forth spirits from the depths, particularly during times of powerful storms, when the lighthouse dims.
    - **Hidden Passage**: A trapdoor leading to an underground tunnel that connects to the rocky coast, potentially allowing cultists to enter unseen from the sea.
    - **Runes and Glyphs**: The walls are inscribed with runes tied to necromancy or illusion, suggesting the cult might be using dark magic to cloak their movements or intentions.

### 4. Confrontation or Chase

- **Cult Encounter**: As the party investigates, they might encounter a few cultists returning to the hideout. The cultists could try to flee or stall the party while casting spells to alert others.
- **Pursuit or Ambush**: A chase might lead through Beacon’s Watch, into narrow alleys or even along the island's rocky coast. Alternatively, the cultists might try to trap the party in the tunnels beneath the property.

### 5. Revelation and Follow-Up Leads

- **Uncovering the Plot**: Among the clues, the party finds that the Order of the Pale Hand is planning a ritual using the magical lighthouse. They intend to dim the light, summoning dark creatures or spirits to gain control over the island.
- **Next Steps**: The party can report their findings to the authorities, setting up a potential confrontation where they join forces with the guards to stop the cult's ritual. Alternatively, they might decide to go alone, infiltrating a cult meeting or sabotaging the ritual to save Protector's Point from whatever dark forces the Order intends to unleash.

This approach keeps the mystery alive, lets the players investigate freely, and gradually exposes the Order of the Pale Hand's dark intentions on Protector's Point!
