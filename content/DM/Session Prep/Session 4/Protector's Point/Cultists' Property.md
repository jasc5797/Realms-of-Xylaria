- Front door is locked requiring a 15 DC slight of hand check
- The inside of the building is small and appears to be someone's spartan house.
- On closer inspection their is a trap door that leads down to the laboratory under the bed
- There is a basin in the center of the room full of magical items
- As the experiment starts the items begin to glow a pale white light before becoming a glowing fluid that melts together in the basin and begins to pour onto the floor forming the outline of the [[Pale Hand]]
- Smokey finger light tendrils reach out from the shape to the chest of the people in each of the holding cells
- A crystal is lowered from the ceiling with an angry red light and a beam of energy arcs from it to the glowing fluid on the floor. Causing it to flash into red and begin sparking and bubbling. The people in the chambers begin to scream as they course with red energy. They begin to bleed from their eyes, noses, and ears.

Here's an expanded outline for this intense scene, with added detail to enhance the tension and atmosphere:

### Breaking In
- **Locked Front Door**: The weathered door is reinforced with iron bands and bears strange scratch marks near the bottom, hinting at attempts to force it open before. The DC 15 Sleight of Hand check allows the party to unlock it with a soft click, revealing a small, eerily quiet interior.
  
### Inside the Spartan House
- **Sparse Furnishings**: The house contains only the bare essentials—an old wooden chair, a dusty table with a few burnt-down candles, and a single bed pushed up against the wall. The atmosphere feels cold and unlived-in, as though someone had been using it only as a temporary hideout.
- **Perception Clue**: A DC 12 Perception check reveals a slight scuff on the floor near the bed, suggesting something heavy has been moved repeatedly. Moving the bed aside reveals a trapdoor, rough and unpolished, with a simple iron handle.

### The Laboratory
- **Descending Into the Lab**: The trapdoor leads to a narrow staircase descending into a dimly lit, cold stone chamber. Torches flicker on the walls, casting unsettling shadows over shelves filled with mysterious vials, scrolls, and strange bone-like artifacts.
- **Laboratory Description**: The center of the room is dominated by the basin filled with a variety of magical items, some of which bear runic markings. The air is thick with an acrid smell, and the occasional drip echoes, intensifying the unsettling atmosphere.
- **Holding Cells**: Along the walls, three barred cells hold prisoners in ragged clothing, their faces etched with fear and exhaustion. They react weakly to the party’s entrance, too drained to speak, but their eyes widen as they see the setup in the center of the room.

### The Experiment Begins
- **Activation of the Basin**: As soon as the party steps near the basin, the magical items within begin to pulse with a pale, ghostly light. Each object seems to liquefy, forming a silvery fluid that swirls together, taking the shape of the Pale Hand's symbol on the floor.
- **Tendrils Reach Out**: Wispy, smoke-like tendrils extend from the fluid's outline, creeping towards the prisoners in the cells. The tendrils seem alive, pulsing with a rhythmic energy as they draw closer to the captives’ chests.

### The Red Crystal
- **Descent of the Crystal**: Suddenly, a crystal embedded in the ceiling lowers into view, its angry red light illuminating the room with an ominous glow. A loud hum fills the air as it charges up, and then a crackling arc of energy shoots from the crystal to the liquid on the floor.
- **Transformation of the Fluid**: The fluid flashes a vivid red, beginning to bubble and spark. The once ghostly tendrils now turn crimson, crackling with sinister energy as they fully attach to the captives, who let out tortured screams. The room reverberates with their cries as their bodies are wracked by waves of red energy.
  
### Gruesome Effects on the Prisoners
- **Horrific Reactions**: The prisoners’ bodies convulse, and their veins begin to glow faintly with the same red light. Blood starts trickling from their eyes, noses, and ears, staining their faces as their screams become hoarse and agonized.
- **Energy Transfer**: The crystal appears to draw energy from the prisoners’ suffering, intensifying its glow with every second. The cult’s magic seems to be siphoning life from the captives, fueling whatever dark ritual is underway.

### Ending the Ritual
- **Interrupting the Process**: The party might have moments to react—whether trying to shatter the crystal, dispel the magic, or rescue the prisoners from their cells before it’s too late.
- **Consequences**: If the ritual is disrupted, the liquid dissipates, and the crystal shatters with a burst of red energy. However, the prisoners may suffer lasting effects, perhaps hinting that their life force was partially absorbed, leaving them weakened or cursed.

This setup creates a chilling, high-stakes encounter that highlights the Order of the Pale Hand’s cruel experiments and gives the party a chance to confront them in a darkly immersive scene.

### 1. **Crimson Crystal Shard**

- **Description**: A small shard from the shattered red crystal, still faintly pulsing with residual energy.
- **Effect**: Grants advantage on Arcana checks related to necromancy or life-draining magic when held. However, prolonged exposure causes minor psychic damage (1d4) once per day, as the shard has lingering malevolent energy.

### 2. **Vial of Liquid Shadow**

- **Description**: A swirling dark fluid in a glass vial sealed with wax bearing the symbol of the Pale Hand.
- **Effect**: When splashed on a creature or surface, it shrouds the target in shadow, granting advantage on Stealth checks for one hour. However, there’s a 20% chance it backfires, causing disadvantage on Perception checks as the shadow begins to cling too tightly to the user’s eyes.

### 3. **Scroll of Dark Vision**

- **Description**: A scroll of aged parchment inscribed with jagged symbols and runes in a language akin to Infernal.
- **Effect**: Grants darkvision up to 60 feet for 8 hours to a creature who reads the scroll aloud. Once used, the reader hears whispers in an unknown language for a short time (purely atmospheric effect).

### 4. **Rune-Etched Dagger**

- **Description**: A small, ceremonial dagger with runes carved along the blade and a hilt wrapped in black leather.
- **Effect**: Functions as a +1 dagger that deals an additional 1d4 necrotic damage on a critical hit. Once per long rest, it allows the wielder to cast _Inflict Wounds_ at first level, using the dagger as a focus.

### 5. **Amulet of Drained Essence**

- **Description**: A silver amulet with a small, clear crystal in the center, which occasionally flickers with a faint red glow.
- **Effect**: When worn, the amulet grants the wearer resistance to necrotic damage for 24 hours but causes disadvantage on saving throws against fear effects. Once per day, the wearer can use the amulet to stabilize a creature at 0 hit points.

### 6. **Book of the Bleeding Veil**

- **Description**: A tome bound in dark leather, its pages filled with descriptions of rituals and spells that manipulate life energy. Blood-like stains appear on the edges of each page.
- **Effect**: Acts as an Arcane Focus. A wizard or warlock studying the book over a short rest can prepare one necromancy spell up to 3rd level they don't know for 24 hours. The book contains disturbing content that causes 1d4 psychic damage if read for more than an hour in one sitting.

### 7. **Phantom Powder**

- **Description**: A small pouch of grayish powder that feels cold to the touch.
- **Effect**: Throwing the powder into the air casts _Invisibility_ in a 10-foot radius around the caster, lasting for one minute. Anyone in this radius becomes invisible until they attack or cast a spell. The pouch has three uses.

### 8. **Locket of Unseen Chains**

- **Description**: A delicate silver locket with the faint imprint of a hand on its cover. Inside, it contains a small mirror that reflects a shadowy version of the viewer.
- **Effect**: Once per day, the wearer can cast _Hold Person_ on a target within 30 feet, using a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. However, the locket exacts a toll, inflicting 1d4 psychic damage to the user each time it’s activated.

### 9. **Tome of Life and Death**

- **Description**: This thick, iron-bound tome has pages filled with diagrams of the human body, annotated with eerie instructions for manipulating life force.
- **Effect**: Grants +1 to Medicine checks when consulted. A character attuned to the book gains advantage on death-saving throws but suffers disadvantage on Constitution saving throws while attuned, as the tome subtly drains vitality.

### 10. **Dust of False Death**

- **Description**: A small vial of gray dust with flecks of red, labeled in a shaky script.
- **Effect**: When sprinkled on a creature, it makes them appear dead to magical effects that detect life, such as _Detect Life_ or _Detect Thoughts_. The effect lasts for up to one hour. This could be useful for creating a ruse or faking death temporarily.

### Gold & Valuables

1. **Cult Coin Pouch**: A small leather pouch stamped with a handprint symbol. It contains **120 gold pieces**, **80 silver pieces**, and **10 small blood-red gems** (worth 5 gp each). The pouch’s weight feels heavier than it should, hinting at the cult’s obsession with ritual sacrifice and symbolism.
    
2. **Chest of Mixed Valuables**: Hidden under one of the tables in the lab, a sturdy wooden chest contains:
    
    - **150 gold pieces** neatly stacked in small cloth bags.
    - **Three ornate silver goblets** inlaid with tiny onyx stones, worth 15 gp each.
    - A **set of gilded scales** (used to weigh ingredients for rituals) worth 20 gp.
3. **Bag of Cult Tokens**: A small pouch filled with **12 bronze tokens** inscribed with the cult’s symbol. Each token is worth 10 gp to a collector or merchant interested in rare and strange coins.
    

### Potions

1. **Potion of Healing (x3)**: Basic potions that restore 2d4 + 2 HP. These are labeled with a red ribbon around the neck of the bottle, indicating that they were likely used to sustain cult members during their twisted experiments.
    
2. **Potion of Greater Healing**: Restores 4d4 + 4 HP. This potion is in a tall, black glass bottle with a silver stopper, intended for high-ranking cult members. Its contents glow faintly red when shaken.
    
3. **Elixir of Darkvision**: When consumed, this elixir grants **Darkvision up to 60 feet** for 8 hours. The liquid inside is a shimmering, deep gray, swirling mysteriously when agitated. This potion would be useful for anyone navigating dark places, like tunnels or dungeons.
    
4. **Potion of Necrotic Resistance**: A dark green, slightly viscous potion with flecks of silver swirling within. Drinking it grants **resistance to necrotic damage** for one hour, which may have been used by cult members to withstand their own life-draining rituals.
    
5. **Potion of Ghost Step**: A pale, almost transparent potion that lets the drinker become **incorporeal for 1 minute**, allowing them to pass through walls or objects once. This potion is likely used for escape, as its side effect leaves the drinker feeling intensely cold and drained afterward.
    
6. **Elixir of False Life**: Grants **1d10+3 temporary HP** for one hour. This elixir is a murky, gray color and has a bitter taste. It’s often used by the cultists to bolster themselves before engaging in dangerous rituals.
    

### Other Possible Finds

- **Basic Alchemist Supplies**: These can be sold for 10 gp or used by an alchemist character to create additional potions.
- **Herbs and Alchemical Ingredients**: Various dried herbs and odd ingredients valued at 25 gp in total, potentially usable in potion-making or sold to an apothecary.

These items add both practicality and reward to the party’s investigation, with healing and resistance potions providing essential support and a decent amount of gold to make the trip worthwhile.
