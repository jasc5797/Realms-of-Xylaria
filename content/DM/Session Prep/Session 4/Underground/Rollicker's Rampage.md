### Rollicker's Rampage - The Fighting Pit of Sylmare

Rolickers Rampage is a rough-and-tumble underground fight club, where locals and travelers alike gather to witness thrilling brawls, place bets, and test their mettle. Located beneath the bustling city of Sylmare, the den has an old, carved-stone ambiance with flickering lanterns and the lingering scent of sweat, ale, and blood. The den is operated by a loose guild of fight enthusiasts and is well-known in the underbelly of Sylmare, though its location is only disclosed to those in the know. This is where Steve from The Thirsty Goat sends adventurers looking for thrills, coin, and information.

#### Layout of the Arena

- **The Pit**: A circular stone pit ringed by torchlight where the fights take place. It’s big enough for single duels and group skirmishes.
- **The Bleachers**: Makeshift seating on rough-hewn stone benches, packed with a mix of locals, travelers, and shady characters.
- **Betting Stalls**: Two booths set up by the bookies where people can place and cash out bets.
- **The Bar**: A small bar on one side of the room, dimly lit and tended by a local barkeep with connections to the underground scene.

### Key NPCs

- **Bob “Smokey” Voss (Barkeep)**  
    Smokey is the manager and bartender at Rolickers Rampage, a wiry, middle-aged man with a scar along his jaw, full head of hair, and fingers stained from years of rolling tobacco. When the party mentions Steve's name, he gives a slight nod of approval, adding, “Any friend of Steve’s is welcome here—but only if they’re ready to spill some blood or coin.” Smokey can provide information about upcoming matches, competitors, and betting odds.
    
- **Magnus “The Bookie” Cray**  
    Magnus is a broad-shouldered, sharp-eyed man who runs the betting operation. A former fighter himself, Magnus transitioned to betting when he could no longer fight, and he knows all the odds and regulars. If the players wish to place bets, he’ll give them the rundown on available matches and odds. He’s also the one to speak with if the players wish to join the fight roster or set up a team fight.
    
- **Esme the Healer**  
    A skilled medic with a reputation for mending the worst wounds fighters bring back. Esme is hard-hearted, practical, and known to demand a steep fee for non-combatants who need healing. She can also heal the players after a fight, for a price.
    
- **Regular Fighters**
    
    - **Braxton “The Boulder”**: A towering human known for his unbreakable defense and brute strength.
    - **Nimble Nia**: A halfling fighter famous for her quick movements and dual daggers.
    - **The Smoke Twins**: A pair of tiefling siblings who specialize in tag-team tactics, always fighting as a pair.
- **Audience & Bookies**  
    In addition to Magnus, smaller-time bookies wander around the bleachers, making side bets on nearly every aspect of the fight. They’re a mix of shady rogues, grumpy dwarves, and eager gamblers who often shout and jeer at the fighters.

    - Odds are determined by Magnus, typically based on fighter reputation and past performance.
    - Payout: Based on odds, ranging from 1.5x to 3x their bet amount.
2. **Specific Outcome**: Players can bet on specific conditions, like a fighter being knocked out in under three rounds or a particular combatant scoring a critical hit.
    
    - Payout: Odds are higher, with payouts ranging from 3x to 5x depending on the difficulty of the outcome.

### Mechanics for Fighting in the Arena

The players can either bet or participate in the fights, and they have the option of fighting individually or entering as a group.

#### **Individual Duels**

- **Rules**: Fighters can’t use lethal force (any attack that would bring an opponent to 0 HP stops just short, causing them to yield).
- **Structure**: Matches are typically one-on-one. Fighters can use any non-lethal weapon or spell, though spells that deal excessive damage may be disallowed (based on Smokey’s call).
- **Prize**: 100 gold per victory.

#### **Group Fights**

- **Rules**: Teams of 2-5 can face off against each other or against local NPC groups (such as The Smoke Twins and Braxton).
- **Structure**: Team battles follow the same rules as individual fights, with a no-lethal-force policy and a referee overseeing.
- **Prize**: 250 gold to split among team members.

#### **Grand Brawl**

- **Rules**: A free-for-all with the last team standing declared the winner.
- **Structure**: Up to 4 teams can enter the pit at once, and alliances are allowed but often dissolve quickly. Fighters are required to yield when they drop below 5 HP.
- **Prize**: The current grand prize is **“The Silver-Helm Crown”**—a magical circlet that grants advantage on Intimidation checks and resistance to psychic damage (1d4 times per long rest). This prize is rotated out every month, and players who win must defend it in future Grand Brawls.

#### Battle Conditions

- **Non-lethal Attacks Only**: All combatants must declare attacks as non-lethal when they would bring a target to 0 HP.
- **Weapons and Armor**: Weapons and armor are provided if needed, though most fighters bring their own equipment.
- **Magic Restrictions**: Healing spells are allowed, but no summoning, teleportation, or spells above 3rd level.

### Potential Plot Hooks and Twists

- **Mystery Fighter**: A mysterious masked fighter has been sweeping the arena, never speaking and winning all matches with eerie skill. Smokey suspects they may be connected to the [[Blackthorne Syndicate]].
- **The Healer’s Secret**: Esme’s healing salves are a cut above regular medicine, and they come at a price for those outside the fights. Rumors circulate that she has a stash of rare herbs stolen from [[Sylmare’s Gray Hollow]], and she may offer discounts to adventurers willing to keep quiet.
- **The Big Bet**: Magnus might give the party inside information on an upcoming fight in exchange for a hefty cut of their winnings, leading them into a web of alliances and betrayals in Sylmare’s underground scene.
