### 3. **Outpost at Sea – The Lighthouse Mystery**

- **Mission Brief:** After discovering the smuggling routes or references to the outpost, Isvar sends the party to investigate the lighthouse out to sea near [[Sylmare]]. Rumors suggest it’s a meeting point for smugglers and pirates linked to the [[Shadow Group]]. The party must uncover what’s being smuggled and who’s behind it.
- **Encounters:** Pirates, sea monsters, and an ancient magical artifact hidden within the lighthouse that controls the tides.
- **Plot Hook:** The outpost is revealed to be a front for a larger operation involving forbidden magic. The artifact found within may hold secrets about the [[Shadow Group]]'s endgame.

### 4. **Tracking a [[Shadow Group]] Leader**

- **Mission Brief:** A key leader of the [[Shadow Group]] has been spotted in the outskirts of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. Isvar tasks the party with hunting them down, uncovering their plans, and possibly extracting crucial information about the group's next big move. This mission could take them to remote villages or hidden hideouts in the countryside.
- **Encounters:** Ambushes from mercenaries hired by the [[Shadow Group]], or magical traps set by the leader.
- **Plot Hook:** The leader drops hints about a much bigger plot involving political unrest in the [[Trisfir Kingdom]], which can expand the campaign scope.

### 5. **Sabotage the [[Clan Tanithil]] Operation**

- **Mission Brief:** After the infiltration of the warehouse, Isvar believes a more aggressive approach is necessary. He orders the party to sabotage another of [[Clan Tanithil]]'s major operations, possibly a shipment of dangerous contraband meant to fund the [[Shadow Group]]. The party must intercept or destroy this shipment before it reaches its destination.
- **Encounters:** Mercenaries, an elite mage, or rival factions vying for control of the contraband.
- **Plot Hook:** The contraband turns out to be something much more sinister than expected, like a weapon or magical device capable of causing mass destruction, further complicating the party’s decision-making.

These missions keep the party grounded in the immediate region of [[Sylmare]] and [[Trisfir Kingdom]] while introducing larger, world-building elements tied to the [[Shadow Group]]. The outpost lighthouse and underground sections serve as natural locations for exploration, while each mission can reveal new layers of the [[Shadow Group]]'s network.
