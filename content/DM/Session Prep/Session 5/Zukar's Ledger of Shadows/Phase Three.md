**"Phase Three Initiated: Pale Conversion Protocol"**  
**To Overseer Z.T.**  
The Order’s agents have successfully infiltrated many of [[Sylmare]]’s temples. Our operatives have identified clerics with wavering faith or personal grievances. These will serve as the first conversions.

The ritual chambers are prepared at [[Beacon's Watch]] as requested. Ensure the chosen clerics are brought to us in small groups to avoid suspicion. The essence of The Palehand shall strip away their old ties, molding them into conduits of our faith.

Once turned, they will stay loyal to The Palehand, and thus stay loyal to us. They can be sent to infiltrate the city acting as they normally would. We will have them keep a low profile all while sowing discord among the faithful and bringing doubt into the heart of [[Sylmare]]’s citizen. When the time is ripe any resistance to the divine truth will crumble.

Fail not in this task, for The Palehand’s gaze is upon us all. His patience is finite, and His justice… unyielding.

**- Signed, The Pale Seer**
