> Description of [[Sylmare]]


> Description of work rendered for [[Clan Tanithil]] as well as recent upgrade to living situation


Allow time to explore [[Sylmare]]. Showcase the use of magical artifacts across the city, and within the home. Things like a pipe that uses sigils to work like a vape when hit, an elevator that uses large gears and gravity magic, and other household appliances [[Sylmare Showcase]].

Talk about the festival that is going on in the city in remembrance of the formation of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. During this festival the streets are packed with celebrants, as the royal family travels to a sacred site outside of the city to perform a ritual. After the ritual the Royal family is paraded down the main thoroughfare to the castle. Many line the streets to catch a glimpse of the royal precession. The festivities usual carry on late into the night.   

There should be events, attractions, and games for the festival like an archery contest that could have a prize like bracers that grant an extra 5 ft of distance on shots with a bow. Other ideas are arm wrestling, general wrestling and druid bear wrestling, bobbing for apples, throwing knives, pie eating contest. One of the attractions could be a total scam

There should also be street vendors selling food and trinkets. Meat skewers, meat and vegetable pies, candies, caramelized good berrys that keep for longer. Pins and keychains for each of the clans and some that focus on the eclipse. Many vendors sell eclipse glasses

Come up with a market area and at least a few shops. Have a [[Tinker Gnome]] shop for artifacts and a [[Thri-kreen]] shop for enchantments. These shops are abutting. These shops seems to outwardly have a rivalry as their purveyors, and respectively [[Chak-tha]] and [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]], do not get along on the surface. However, they will always help the other in a pinch, and the combining of their skills can create even more powerful magical items. Heck maybe they could even become a thing on. [[Boltz]]  gets along very well with [[Chak-tha]], much to [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]]'s chagrin. [[Boltz]] spends an extra time that he has not working on the horticultural arts around [[Wobblesproket's Wonders]] at [[Runes of the Forge]] doing the same thing. There is also be an alchemic shop run by an elvish druid which can supply components and potions. There could also be a a spellbook/scroll shop.

[[Chak-tha]]'s shop is setup like an armorers shop. It mostly has simple weapons, like +1 weapons, and elemental effects as well as some simple armor with basic enchantment. He can make custom enchantments on existing items, but it can be prohibitively expensive to add additional effects to items that are already magical.

[[Horatio]] has many magical trinkets and artifacts, (maybe perpetual penjamin or automatic doors). He also has a few weapons and armor with additional special effects. These may be infused with [[Chak-tha]]'s enchantments. His shop also has an [[Autognome]], named [[Boltz]], that [[Horatio]] created to help around the shop. [[Boltz]] is easily distracted or doesn't like to work, preferring something strange like gardening

[[Emelden Tanithil]] is the parties main contact with [[Clan Tanithil]]. He eventually meets the party at their home. He is a sloppy half elf who appears to be middle aged. He has a bit of a beer belly and his cloths are a little stained. He asks if it is okay to have a smoke. He pulls out a pipe a snuffbox of pipeweed. He packs the pipe, but instead of lighting the pipeweed he takes a toke on the pipe. This causes runes from the [[Kut'al Conclave]] to begin to glow on the outside of the bowl and the consequently the pipeweed begins to burn. Then he tells them that some plans fell through and a shipment cart that was supposed to make it out of the city before the parade have not left yet, and the crew is no where to be found. He asks that they bring it up the main thoroughfare to a way point so that it can be picked up later as soon as the streets clear out. He tells them about an alley that they can store the cart relatively safely, if it is covered.

Maybe have a small combat encounter with some cutpurses [DNDBeyond Encounter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounters/e16d74e6-94ca-463e-9090-b988e0a615ad)

Maybe have group ability check for getting the wagon up through the main thoroughfare through the crowds unimpeded. 

Guide the party to leave out the backside of the alley as the main road is really crowded. Maybe [[Emelden]] recommends a spot they can go to from the alley for a good view of the parade. Have the party watch the Royal procession go by and then have the cart explode when the procession is near.


If we have more time then the session can continue. The party can decide what to do next but in the end they will be tracked down the Master Servant, [[Isver]], of [[Clan Trisfir]] who is secretly also the spy master for the family. He should take them into custody for interrogation with a zone of truth. He is mischievous and shouldn't be taken at face value, which he plays off things with a rye hummer. He will take a liking to the party if things go well. He will slap them around a bit, but once proven innocent he will let them free. On there way out he will summon them to his office and offer to hire them on to investigate the group behind the attack. He should show them a scrap of the same symbol from the [[Unknown Letter]] that was taken from the wreckage of the explosion. Eventually he will let them free and even let them keep their accommodations and an additional stipend as long as they agree to help him investigate the secret group.

Plan for infiltration of a [[Clan Tanithil]] warehouse. [Battle Map](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmaps/comments/rv70f1/warehouse_31x18/)
The party has been to this warehouse before so knows its layout
### **1. Preparation and Reconnaissance**

**Objective**: Gather information about the warehouse and its security.

- **Initial Intelligence**:
    - **Gather Intel**: Use streetwise or local contacts to learn about the warehouse's layout, guards, and any recent activities. Look for potential weak points in security.
    - **Surveillance**: Observe the warehouse from a distance to understand guard routines, patrol patterns, and any unusual activities.

### **2. Infiltration Plan**

**Objective**: Enter the warehouse stealthily and locate the needed clues.

- **Disguise and Entry**:
    
    - **Disguises**: The party could use disguises to blend in with warehouse staff or guards. Alternatively, they might use a magical means of concealment or invisibility.
    - **Access Points**: Identify and use less-guarded entry points like a side door or roof access. If needed, create a diversion to draw attention away from the main entrance.
- **Navigating the Warehouse**:
    
    - **Guard Patrols**: Pay attention to guard schedules and avoid detection. Use stealth and make use of shadows and cover.
    - **Mapping the Warehouse**: Create a mental or physical map of the interior to locate key areas such as storage rooms, offices, and any potential hidden sections.

### **3. Searching for Clues**

**Objective**: Find the symbol and any other evidence connecting the warehouse to the explosion and the shadowy group.

- **Symbol Matching**:
    
    - **Locate Symbol**: Search for the symbol matching the one the party found previously. Look for it on documents, crates, or hidden compartments.
    - **Document Examination**: Search for any correspondence, ledgers, or items that could reveal connections to the shadowy group or the explosive incident.
- **Interrogation and Discoveries**:
    
    - **Interrogation**: If the party encounters any guards or warehouse staff, they might need to use persuasion or intimidation to extract information.
    - **Hidden Secrets**: Look for secret rooms or hidden caches that might contain critical evidence.

### **4. Escape and Report**

**Objective**: Exit the warehouse safely and report findings to Isver.

- **Safe Exit**:
    
    - **Avoid Detection**: As the party leaves, they should avoid alerting additional guards or drawing attention.
    - **Escape Routes**: Have a plan for a quick exit, including possible disguises or alternate routes if things go awry.
- **Reporting**:
    
    - **Deliver Findings**: Provide Isver with all gathered evidence, including the symbol and any documents or items linking Clan Tanithil to the explosion.

### **5. Encounter with Shadowy Group**

**Objective**: Prepare for potential encounters or follow-up leads.

- **Potential Confrontation**: Be prepared for a confrontation with the shadowy group if their presence is uncovered during the infiltration.
- **Clues to Follow Up**: Use any new information to follow leads and further investigate the shadowy groupâ€™s motives and connections.
