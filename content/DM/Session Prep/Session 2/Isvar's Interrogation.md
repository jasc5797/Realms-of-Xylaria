### Talking with **Isvar Zunil**

**Isvar Zunil** is a slender, unassuming elf with sharp features and a perpetual glint of mischief in his eyes. His smile never quite reaches his eyes, hinting at the layers of manipulation beneath his composed exterior. A man of many secrets, he plays with truth and deception like an artist, relishing in keeping others off balance. His clothes are impeccably clean and of noble quality, yet he moves with the silent grace of someone used to working in the shadows. While his voice carries an air of sophistication, there's a dangerous edge to it, as though he is always five steps ahead in any conversation.

### **Pre-Interrogation Dialog**

As the guards drag the party into a darkened chamber deep within the royal palace, Isvar waits, his back turned to the group. The door creaks shut, and for a moment, there’s only silence, save for the rustling of his fine robes.

Isvar:  
*"Ah... well, well, what do we have here? The brave heroes of the hour, if one could call such a debacle bravery."*  
(He turns to face them, a bemused smile on his lips.)  
*"What an eventful day you’ve had—so close to a parade, and then... boom! How unfortunate, truly. I do hope your hearing wasn’t too affected. The sounds of explosions can be so terribly disorienting. Of course, it’s quite rude to be part of one without a proper invitation."*

He steps closer to the party, eyeing each one carefully. 

Isvar:  
*"Still, I must say, your timing was impeccable. A little too impeccable, if you ask me."*  
(He chuckles lightly before snapping his fingers. The familiar shimmer of a **Zone of Truth** begins to spread across the room.)  
*"But I digress—let's get straight to the heart of things, shall we?"*

### **Interrogation Approach**

Throughout the interrogation, **Isvar Zunil** is meticulous but never overtly cruel. He’s testing the party, looking for reactions, slipping subtle threats and half-truths into the conversation to see how they respond. He occasionally slaps the table or leans in close, his voice barely above a whisper, as though he’s revealing some great secret. 

He uses his wit to unsettle the party members, often turning their words back on them. For example:

Isvar:  
(To Edwin)  
*"You know, young Ravenswood, I have great respect for your house. Or rather, I *had* respect for them. A pity really... a family so esteemed. But you, dear boy... How strange it is to see you here, alive, when all reports suggest otherwise. Care to shed some light on that little inconsistency?"*  
(He leans back, a finger tapping his lips thoughtfully.)  
*"Perhaps you're not who you claim to be... or perhaps you are and you've been hiding from more than just the truth?"*

**Isvar's tone is always playful, mischievous, as if enjoying a private joke that the party is not in on.**

### **Dirt on Each Character**

- **Edwin Ravenswood**:  
   Isvar:  
   *"Ah, **House Ravenswood**. A name that once carried so much weight, now little more than whispers in forgotten halls. You’ve been quite the ghost yourself, haven't you? Disappearing at just the right moment. I wonder... did you ruffle the wrong feathers in the **Etral Kingdom**, or is this just a grand act of survival?"*  
   (He leans closer.)  
   *"Or maybe you’re just another pretender... after all, Edwin Ravenswood hasn’t been seen in quite some time, has he?"*

- **Gnutz Snatcher**:  
   Isvar:  
   *"Oh, you. I must admit, I haven’t quite figured you out yet. But I do know this... you’re running from something. A village burned, lives shattered in some ‘tragic raid,’ they say? Pity, really. You must be so desperate for vengeance. Of course, I hear whispers that the real culprit behind those raids... well, let's just say they had motives beyond simple destruction. Did you know **Ozai** of the **Veilbound Syndicate** had his hand in that little... misunderstanding?"*

- **John-Boy Blackthorne**:  
   Isvar:  
   *"Now you, Mr. Blackthorne... what an enigma you are. Your name turns up in every scrap of history I’ve looked through, like a bad coin that keeps showing up. Dozens of deaths under your name across the kingdoms. Impressive, really. And yet, here you are, alive and well. I do hope you’re not trying to compete with death itself, or is it just some poetic title for those with a reckless streak?"*

- **Miera Ashglade**:  
   Isvar:  
   *"Ah, yes... the tragic tale of the **Ashglades**. Such a fine family, too bad their fortune fell into ruin. And you, my dear... running from a betrothed who still scours the lands, searching for the one who escaped him. I wonder, how long do you think you can keep running before he finds you? My, my... if you weren't so interesting, I'd say you were doomed to repeat your family's fate."*

### **Post-Interrogation Dialog**

After the interrogation, when the truth starts to become clear, Isvar leans back in his chair, clearly enjoying himself.

Isvar:  
*"Well, well, it seems I may have misjudged you all. No bomb-loving traitors in this group, after all... at least, not the kind I was hoping for. Consider yourselves lucky... for now."*  
(He gestures for the guards to release the party from their restraints.)

As the party leaves, Isvar calls them back, his voice losing some of its earlier amusement.

Isvar:  
*"Before you go, I have a... proposition for you. A little job, if you will. You see, we found something in the wreckage."*  
(He reveals a **scrap of the symbol** from the **Unknown Letter**.)  
*"I trust this looks familiar? It seems you're caught up in something bigger than you think. The royal family might be willing to overlook today's... incident, but I’ll need you to investigate this little group that caused all the trouble."*

He smirks as he delivers the final part of his pitch.

Isvar:  
*"You’ll be handsomely compensated, of course. Your current accommodations remain yours, and a nice little stipend to go with it. The alternative? Well, let’s just say, today’s headlines could take quite the scandalous turn if you refuse."*

With that, he lets them leave, but not without a parting shot.

Isvar:  
*"Try not to blow up any more parades, will you? I hate cleaning up such a mess."*

### Final Offer

Isvar leaves the party with a choice, but one heavily weighted in his favor. Whether they choose to accept or resist, they will inevitably end up working for him, setting the stage for future intrigue and missions. His rye humor and manipulative charm should leave a lasting impression, making him both an adversary and potential ally they can never quite trust.
