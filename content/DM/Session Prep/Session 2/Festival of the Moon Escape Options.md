# Basic Escape Scenarios

### 1. **Initial Escape**

When the party realizes they’re about to be apprehended, they’ll need to make a quick decision on how to escape. If they choose to run:

- **Perception (DC 14)** to quickly assess the best escape route (e.g., alleyways, crowded streets, or rooftops).
    
- **Stealth (DC 15)** to slip away unnoticed into the crowd or shadows.
    
    If the party splits up, individual checks can be used here, and failure might result in some members being tracked more easily than others.

### 2. **Navigating the Streets**

The guards will likely give chase. The party will need to use their wits and skills to lose them in the busy city streets of **Sylmare**.

- **Athletics or Acrobatics (DC 13)** to push through crowded streets, leap over obstacles, or climb onto nearby buildings.
    
    - Success: The party gains some distance on the guards.
    - Failure: The guards close the gap and may gain advantage on spotting them.
- **Survival (DC 12)** to navigate the city’s winding alleys or find shortcuts.
    
    - Success: The party locates a shortcut that helps them break line of sight.
    - Failure: They may end up in a dead end or accidentally lead themselves into a more heavily patrolled area.

### 3. **Hiding**

If the party chooses to hide rather than run, or if they need to lie low for a moment:

- **Stealth (DC 14-16 depending on the hiding spot)** to find a hiding spot and remain concealed while guards search the area.
    
    - Success: The party finds a decent place to hide, such as blending into a crowd, ducking into a shop, or climbing into a hidden alcove.
    - Failure: The guards spot them, and the chase resumes.
    
    If any members have spells like **Invisibility** or other illusions, this would be a great time to use them for advantage or auto-success.

### 4. **Disguise or Deception**

If a player has proficiency in **Deception** or **Disguise Kits**, they could attempt to change their appearance to blend into the city and evade capture.

- **Deception (DC 15)** or **Performance (DC 15)** to blend into a crowd, act casual, or pretend to be someone else entirely.
    
    - Success: The party successfully avoids suspicion by pretending to be merchants, travelers, or local citizens.
    - Failure: The guards grow more suspicious and focus their search on them.
- **Disguise Kit (DC 13)** for a quick costume change or other transformation.
    
    - Success: A quick change of appearance buys them time or helps them slip past the guards.
    - Failure: The disguise is poorly made or incomplete, and guards might still recognize them.

---

### 5. **Chasing Through Rooftops or Underground**

If the party takes to rooftops or finds an underground passage (sewers, basements), they’ll need to be quick and agile to evade the guards:

- **Acrobatics (DC 14)** to leap between rooftops, scale walls, or balance on narrow beams.
    
    - Success: The party is able to outmaneuver the guards on the rooftops.
    - Failure: A player might slip or fall, potentially alerting the guards to their position.
- **Athletics (DC 12)** to push through obstacles like barricades or debris.
    
    - Success: The party makes their way through with minimal delay.
    - Failure: The guards are able to gain on them, or the party might injure themselves (minor damage).

---

### 6. **Distracting the Guards**

If the players want to get creative, they could use the environment or social situations to create distractions, slowing the guards down.

- **Sleight of Hand (DC 14)** to cause a distraction, such as knocking over a cart, cutting a rope, or triggering a trap or device.
    
    - Success: The guards are delayed as they investigate or deal with the distraction.
    - Failure: The distraction is ineffective, and the guards continue the pursuit.
- **Persuasion (DC 16)** or **Intimidation (DC 16)** to convince a bystander to help mislead the guards or block their path.
    
    - Success: The bystander creates a scene, buys time for the party, or provides a false lead.
    - Failure: The bystander does nothing, and the guards are unaffected.

---

### 7. **Magic and Special Abilities**

If the party has access to spells or abilities that can aid in evasion, consider allowing their use, with appropriate checks:

- **Illusion Spells**: Spells like **Silent Image** or **Minor Illusion** can be used to create distractions or hide the party.
    
    - **Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 15)** for guards to see through the illusion.
- **Invisibility/Pass Without Trace**: A spell like **Pass Without Trace** would give the party advantage on all Stealth checks and add +10 to their rolls, making escape significantly easier.
    
- **Charm Person/Disguise Self**: If a party member casts **Charm Person** on a guard or uses **Disguise Self**, they may attempt to talk their way out of the situation.
    
    - **Charisma Saving Throw (DC varies by spellcaster’s ability)** for the guard.

---

### Final Outcome

- **If the party fails most checks**, the guards eventually corner them and take them into custody for interrogation.
- **If the party succeeds** on most checks but fails at critical moments, the guards eventually catch them after a tense, drawn-out pursuit.
- **If they evade for long enough** (succeeding on a majority of checks), Isvar Zunil might even commend them on their resourcefulness, while still having his network track them down later for interrogation.

This structure allows for flexibility, and the guards' relentless pursuit will build tension even if the party performs well, ultimately funneling them into the final encounter with Isvar Zunil.

# Additional Scenarios

Here are two scenarios—one where the party tries to make it to their home and another where they head to **Wobblesprocket’s Wonders**—both of which will end with the party being captured, even if they've successfully evaded the guards up to that point.

### **Scenario 1: Return to the Party’s Home**

The party believes that returning to their home within the city offers a safe haven, where they can lay low until things calm down. However, this decision will play right into the hands of the guards and **Isvar Zunil's** spy network.

#### **Possible Outcomes**:

1. **Surveillance and Stakeout**:
   - **Outcome**: Unbeknownst to the party, their home has already been placed under surveillance by the city guards. A network of spies and lookouts has been set up nearby to report any suspicious activity. As soon as they return home, the guards, tipped off by a network of street informants, will converge on their location.
   - **Narrative**: As the party settles in, they might notice subtle signs of being watched—a flicker of movement in the window, a shadowy figure disappearing around a corner. Suddenly, a loud knock on the door or the sound of guards bursting in signals that their location has been compromised.

   - **Actionable Checks**: The party might try to barricade the door or escape through a hidden passage (if any), but **Athletics (DC 16)** or **Stealth (DC 15)** checks will likely result in failure as the guards have blocked all exits.
  
2. **False Security**:
   - **Outcome**: The party feels they’ve successfully evaded the guards and relax in their home. However, Isvar Zunil has anticipated their move and sends a small squad of elite guards disguised as regular citizens to blend in before launching a surprise raid.
   - **Narrative**: The guards pose as street vendors or visitors to the house and spring a trap when the party is least expecting it. Their home, once a place of safety, becomes their prison.
   
   - **Checks**: The party could try to make **Perception (DC 18)** or **Insight (DC 16)** checks to spot something amiss, but failing those checks results in them being caught unaware.

3. **Magical Surveillance**:
   - **Outcome**: Isvar Zunil has planted magical wards or enchantments around the party’s home, such as a **Scrying Sensor** or a **Glyph of Warding**, alerting him and his forces the moment they enter.
   - **Narrative**: As soon as the party enters their home, a subtle magical pulse notifies Isvar, and he sends his enforcers. These wards could also trigger immobilizing magic or alarms.
   
   - **Actionable Checks**: They could attempt **Arcana (DC 17)** checks to detect the wards, but failure results in immediate capture.

---

### **Scenario 2: Heading to Wobblesprocket’s Wonders**

If the party decides to hide in **Wobblesprocket’s Wonders**, Horatio Wobblesprocket and **Boltz** the Autognome might offer to help. However, this option also leads to capture due to Isvar’s extensive spy network and resources.

#### **Possible Outcomes**:

1. **Tracking Magic**:
   - **Outcome**: Isvar Zunil has a powerful magical item (like an **Orb of Tracking**) that can pinpoint their location. As soon as the party enters **Wobblesprocket’s Wonders**, Isvar or his agents track them using the magic, and a contingent of guards shows up to surround the shop.
   - **Narrative**: While Horatio and Boltz might try to hide the party in the workshop, the guards will storm in before they can fully prepare. The tension rises as the shop is surrounded, and guards demand the party's surrender.
   
   - **Checks**: The party might try to escape through secret exits, but even **Perception (DC 18)** or **Investigation (DC 17)** checks will lead to failure as guards have covered all possible escape routes. Magical traps set by the guards could also ensnare them.

2. **Horatio's Betrayal**:
   - **Outcome**: Unknown to the party, Horatio Wobblesprocket may have been pressured by Isvar Zunil or the city guards to hand over the group in exchange for protecting his business. He reluctantly agrees, but tries to make it look as though he’s aiding the party.
   - **Narrative**: As Horatio hides the party in the back workshop or basement, he tips off the guards. A few moments later, the shop is surrounded, and the party is trapped inside. Horatio looks on with regret but justifies his actions, saying he had no choice.
   
   - **Checks**: The party could make **Insight (DC 16)** checks to detect Horatio’s guilt, but by the time they realize something is wrong, it’s too late. If they try to confront him, the guards will already be closing in.

3. **Disguised Guards**:
   - **Outcome**: The guards, disguised as customers or delivery men, have infiltrated the shop and lie in wait. As the party relaxes, thinking they're safe, the guards reveal themselves and capture the group in a well-coordinated ambush.
   - **Narrative**: The party might be interacting with Boltz or examining magical items when they realize they’ve walked into a trap. The guards, posing as harmless civilians, quickly surround them, ensuring no chance of escape.

   - **Actionable Checks**: A **Perception (DC 17)** check might help spot the guards’ weapons or odd behavior, but a failed check results in the party being completely caught off guard. If they try to fight, the shop's confined space may make things difficult for the party to gain an advantage.

4. **Guard-Controlled Streets**:
   - **Outcome**: Even if the party manages to reach Wobblesprocket’s Wonders, the guards have locked down the streets surrounding the shop. The party is trapped, with no way to leave without being intercepted by guards. 
   - **Narrative**: Isvar Zunil has locked down the neighborhood with roadblocks, and the shop is under heavy surveillance. The party has no way of leaving without being captured, and as they prepare to flee, they realize they’re surrounded.
   
   - **Checks**: Even a successful **Stealth (DC 18)** or **Acrobatics (DC 17)** check to escape through an alternate route will eventually lead them into an ambush.

### **Capture and Resolution**
Regardless of whether the party reaches their home or Wobblesprocket's Wonders, **Isvar Zunil** has anticipated their moves through his **spy network** or **magical resources**. While they may evade for a while, Isvar's resources and planning are formidable, making their capture inevitable. When captured, Isvar may humor them with sarcastic remarks, as he sees them as valuable assets despite their circumstances.

- **Isvar's Dialog** on Capture:
   - *“Well, I must say, you’ve led quite the merry chase through the city. My men haven’t had such a workout in weeks. But, as amusing as it was, I think we both know it had to end this way.”*
   - *“You’re persistent, I’ll give you that. Unfortunately for you, persistence won’t outrun preparation.”*
   - *“Welcome home. I do hope you’ll forgive the inconvenience of all this... unpleasantness. Now, let’s talk.”*

In either scenario, the party will eventually be brought before Isvar Zunil for interrogation, where the story will continue.
