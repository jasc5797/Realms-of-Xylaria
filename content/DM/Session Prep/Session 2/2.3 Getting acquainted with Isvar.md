Isvar Zunil would offer the party a mixture of enticing rewards and practical incentives to convince them to work for him. He understands how to appeal to their individual desires, while also leveraging their current vulnerable situation.

### **Isvar’s Offer: Rewards and Payment**

1. **Stipend and Lodging**:
   - **Increased Stipend**: Isvar offers to provide a generous monetary reward for each mission completed, starting with a notable sum for their next task. He suggests a regular stipend for ongoing work.
     - *“Consider this a retainer. A show of good faith and a promise of more to come. You’ll find our treasury is not lacking in generosity.”*
   - **Keep Their Lodging**: The party’s current accommodations will not only be maintained, but upgraded subtly—possibly more security or discreet luxury features to make their stay comfortable.
     - *“You’ll find your quarters haven’t been compromised. On the contrary, I’ve made sure they’re better than ever—no strings attached, of course.”*

2. **Legal Immunity**:
   - **Erase the Incident from the Records**: Isvar assures them that their involvement in the bombing will be wiped clean from any official records.
     - *“Your unfortunate involvement in the… incident won’t be a footnote in tomorrow’s news, nor the next. We can be discreet, when we want to.”*

3. **Access to Information**:
   - **Exclusive Intel**: Isvar offers to share crucial intelligence with the party on powerful factions or organizations within the city. This includes dossiers on potential enemies or allies, allowing the party to gain a foothold in Sylmare’s intricate political landscape.
     - *“Information is power, and I’m happy to share it with those who prove useful. You’ll have access to knowledge most could only dream of.”*

4. **Custom Equipment or Artifacts**:
   - **Magical Items**: He might promise to have powerful, custom-made magical items created by trusted sources like Horatio Wobblesprocket or Chak-tha, making their lives easier and missions more effective.
     - *“I hear Horatio’s been working on something truly spectacular. Perhaps I’ll pull a few strings and see if he can fast-track something special for you.”*

5. **Political Influence**:
   - **Favor with the Trisfir Family**: Isvar hints that, if they continue to prove themselves, they could earn the favor of the Trisfir Kingdom, gaining access to political circles or other privileges that come with such connections.
     - *“And who knows? With a few more successful ventures, you might just find yourselves rubbing elbows with the kingdom’s finest. That is, if you’re interested in those kinds of opportunities.”*

### **Isvar’s Request: Infiltrating Clan Tanithil’s Warehouse**

#### **Mission Brief**:
Isvar is direct yet sly in his approach, knowing the party may not yet trust him fully. He frames the mission as a mutually beneficial arrangement, one that clears their name and offers them a chance for deeper involvement in Sylmare’s hidden workings.

1. **Approach with Subtlety**:
   - *“Now, here’s the thing. The bombing—it wasn’t just a lucky shot by some disgruntled thugs. It stinks of coordination. And wouldn’t you know it, we’ve got a little lead, thanks to a certain symbol found in the wreckage.”*
   - *“Clan Tanithil. Fine family, excellent record… except for one little problem. We think they’ve been playing both sides. We’re almost certain they’ve got ties to this shadowy group behind the explosion. We just need proof.”*

2. **He Presents the Symbol**:
   - *“Recognize this?”* Isvar shows the party the symbol from the unknown letter they discovered. *“It was found amidst the wreckage. I have a strong feeling this little mark holds the key to unraveling the whole affair.”*
   - *“It’s also turned up in one of Tanithil’s warehouses. My sources were able to spot it—barely—before we lost track of things. I need someone to go in and see what else they’re hiding.”*

3. **Infiltration Task**:
   - *“I’m not asking you to storm the place. We need subtlety. Discretion. Tanithil’s got a warehouse down by the docks. Supposedly just another storage facility, but I’d wager you’ll find much more if you dig deep enough. Get inside, poke around, and bring back anything suspicious. Names, documents, anything. And keep an eye out for that symbol—it’ll lead you where we need to go.”*

4. **Appeal to Their Skills**:
   - Isvar flatters the party, making them feel uniquely qualified for the job.
     - *“I won’t lie to you. I need professionals, and you’re the only ones who can handle this sort of task. The guards, the agents I usually employ—far too obvious, far too clumsy. You, however, have proven you can handle yourselves in delicate situations.”*

5.  ** Discuss Usefulness to the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] **
- Isvar could frame the party's role as an opportunity to operate in ways that the guards and military simply cannot due to political or legal constraints. Here's how he might put it:
	- *“You see, the guards and soldiers—they have their rules, their protocols. They can’t so much as glance in the wrong direction without paperwork and oversight. But you? You don’t have those... limitations. You can get into places and deal with people the guards can’t touch without causing a scene. Unofficial, untraceable—let’s call it ‘deniable.’ You get the job done, and no one’s the wiser. It’s exactly what I need, and trust me, it’s what the city needs right now. You’re free agents, capable of dipping your toes where others would find themselves in very... hot water.”*
- He’d emphasize that the party's ability to act outside the system gives them a unique edge, making them invaluable for sensitive tasks that demand discretion.

6. **Leverage Their Position**:
   - He subtly reminds them that this job is a way to clear their name while offering long-term benefits.
     - *“Think of it as a way to repay my kindness. Do this, and your names will stay clean. And I’ll make sure your little brush with the law remains our secret. You scratch my back, I scratch yours, and everyone walks away happy.”*

7. **The Offer of Continued Work**:
   - *“Of course, this could be the start of a beautiful arrangement. Succeed here, and there’ll be more where that came from. More coin, more access to the city’s inner workings… maybe even some say in how things are run. I’d say that’s worth a little risk, don’t you think?”*

8. **Final Hook**:
   - Isvar finishes with an offer they can’t refuse, sweetening the deal with both the immediate rewards and the potential for future opportunities.
     - *“Do this, and we’ll wipe away the lingering questions about your involvement in the bombing. And as a gesture of goodwill, we’ll ensure your accommodations remain… comfortable. Oh, and did I mention? There’s a hefty bonus in it for you—something to make sure your efforts are well-rewarded. Think it over. Just don’t take too long. Time, as they say, waits for no one.”*

### **Payment and Terms for the Warehouse Mission**:
- **Gold**: A considerable amount of gold (500-700gp) as an upfront reward, with the promise of more upon completion.
- **Lodging**: Secure housing in the city, fully covered by the Trisfir family, with all amenities included.
- **Magical Equipment**: If the party accepts the mission, Isvar might offer a magical item such as a **Cloak of Invisibility** or **Boots of Elvenkind** to assist with their infiltration, further emphasizing their partnership’s potential.
- **Future Favor**: A vague but tempting promise of influence within the city or royal court should they prove themselves in future tasks.

With Isvar’s calculated blend of threat and reward, he leaves the party little choice but to take on the mission to infiltrate **Clan Tanithil’s** warehouse, setting the stage for deeper intrigue.
