### Scenario Padding: Warehouse Infiltration and Encounter with Emelden Tanithil

#### **Setting the Scene: The Warehouse**
The warehouse is located in a less frequented part of the city near the docks, ostensibly used for storing various goods for Clan Tanithil. It’s a large, shadowy building with high windows and a couple of guarded entrances. Inside, the vast space is cluttered with crates, barrels, and large cloths draped over mysterious shapes—likely more sensitive items. Dim lanterns hang from the ceiling, casting long shadows and creating an atmosphere ripe for sneaking or hiding.

#### **Infiltration Attempts**
- **Stealth Check** (DC 15): To enter the warehouse without drawing attention. Success means they move through the shadows undetected; failure could mean drawing the curiosity of guards.
- **Deception Check** (DC 13): If they encounter any guards they know, they might bluff their way through by pretending to be there on official business.
- **Perception Check** (DC 14): To notice any hidden traps or surveillance before they spring them.

#### **Inside the Warehouse**
As the party navigates through rows of crates and secluded areas, they find documents and items that are clearly not ordinary trade goods—weapons, strange artifacts, and crates marked with the unknown symbol of the Shadow Group.

- **Investigation Check** (DC 16): To uncover hidden documents or evidence linking Clan Tanithil to the bombing. Success reveals letters and plans detailing the cooperation between Clan Tanithil and the Shadow Group; failure means they might miss crucial evidence or trigger a hidden alarm.

#### **Encounter with Emelden Tanithil**
Emelden is in the warehouse overseeing the organization of goods and ensuring sensitive items are well-hidden. The party might stumble upon him or vice versa.

- **Dialogue with Emelden**:
  - *Emelden, noticing the party:* "Ah, what a surprise... to find you here. And after all we've shared, I'd have hoped for a heads-up before you decided to snoop around."
  - *Party's Response*: [Choices could range from aggressive confrontation to attempting to glean more information.]
  - *Emelden, if pressed*: "You think you've uncovered something grand? This... this is just the beginning. You have no idea the forces you're meddling with."

#### **Confrontation or Negotiation**
- **Persuasion/Intimidation Check** (DC 17): To get Emelden to spill more details about the Shadow Group. Success means he reveals fear of reprisals from the group; failure might make him more desperate to escape or attack.

- **Emelden’s Escape Tactics**:
  - **Hidden Traps**: Emelden might trigger a hidden trap to cover his escape (DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid effects like nets or gas).
  - **Summon Guards**: Uses a hidden rune to silently alert Clan Tanithil guards, potentially bringing them into the fray.

#### **Fight or Flight**
- **Combat Mechanics**: If it comes to a fight, Emelden is not a formidable combatant but relies on dirty tricks and traps to defend himself.
- **Escape Mechanics**: If the party captures him, they might question him about:
  - The extent of the Clan's involvement with the Shadow Group.
  - The leaders of the Shadow Group.
  - Planned actions or targets of the group.
  - Safe ways to exit the warehouse as he knows it well.

#### **Fire and Escape**
Suddenly, as the interrogation or search intensifies, a fire breaks out—set by a Shadow Group member or an automated system to destroy evidence.

- **Urgency Mechanics**:
  - **Constitution Saving Throw** (DC 12): To resist the effects of smoke inhalation.
  - **Athletics Check** (DC 15): To navigate quickly through the burning warehouse and avoid falling debris or flames.
  - **Perception Check** (DC 15): To find the safest and quickest route out.

#### **Dialogue as They Escape**:
- *Emelden or Shadow Group Member*: "You fools! You think you’ve won? The flames cleanse everything, and no evidence means no leverage!"
- *Party Response*: [Can be determined based on their style—either defiant, cunning, or desperate to save any remaining evidence.]

#### **Outcome**
The escape from the burning warehouse is harrowing, with the party potentially saving some evidence or losing it all to the fire. Their relationship with Emelden, if he survives, could be a pivotal point—whether he becomes an informant out of fear or revenge, or if he escapes, remains a loose end to be addressed in future sessions.


### Scenario Addition: Betrayal and Fire

As the party interrogates Emelden or searches for more evidence within the warehouse, tension builds. Unexpectedly, the calm is shattered by the sharp twang of a crossbow releasing its bolt. Here's how the scenario could unfold:

#### **Setting the Dramatic Scene**

As the party is in the midst of extracting information from Emelden or debating his fate, a shadowy figure appears from the deeper, darker recesses of the warehouse—a member of the Shadow Group, unseen until now.

- **Perception Check** (DC 16): To notice the assailant before they act. Success means one party member spots a glint of metal or the movement of the crossbow; failure means the attack comes as a complete surprise.

#### **The Attack**

The Shadow Group member, cloaked and masked, aims a heavy crossbow at Emelden. With a cold precision, they shoot, intending to silence him permanently.

- **Dialogue from the Shadow Group Member**:
  - *In a raspy whisper just as they shoot:* "No loose ends, Emelden. You know too much."

- **Reaction from Emelden** (if the bolt hits):
  - *Emelden gasps as the bolt pierces his chest, his eyes wide with shock and betrayal.* "But... I was... loyal..."

- **Party's Immediate Response**:
  - [The party could react with shock, anger, or immediately engage the assailant, depending on their disposition and prior decisions regarding Emelden.]

#### **Confrontation with the Shadow Group Member**

The Shadow Group member does not linger after firing the crossbow bolt. As they turn to flee, possibly setting the warehouse on fire as part of their escape plan, the party has a brief window to act.

- **Initiative Roll**: If the party chooses to engage, they must roll for initiative against the Shadow Group member.
- **Combat Encounter**:
  - The Shadow Group member may use smoke bombs or other obscuring tactics to cover their escape or disorient the party.
  - **Athletics or Acrobatics Check** (DC 15): For the party to chase down the assailant amidst the chaos of the warehouse and the burgeoning fire.

#### **Setting the Fire**

As the confrontation unfolds, regardless of the immediate outcome, the Shadow Group member sets the warehouse ablaze, aiming to destroy all evidence, including Emelden's body.

- **Dialogue as They Set the Fire**:
  - *While lighting the fire, almost as an afterthought:* "Burn it all. Let the flames cleanse our path."

#### **Escaping the Burning Warehouse**

With the warehouse rapidly filling with smoke and flames, the party must make quick decisions.

- **Constitution Saving Throw** (DC 12): To avoid coughing and choking on the smoke.
- **Investigation or Survival Check** (DC 15): To find the quickest and safest way out of the increasingly dangerous warehouse.
- **Dexterity Saving Throw** (DC 14): To dodge falling debris and navigate through the fiery obstacles.

#### **Aftermath and Reflection**

Once outside, the party can reflect on the betrayal and murder of Emelden, reassess their understanding of the Shadow Group's ruthlessness, and decide their next steps in unraveling or combating this clandestine organization.

- **Party Dialogue**:
  - *One of the members, looking back at the burning warehouse:* "They're cleaning house. Emelden was just a piece... We need to be careful, or we'll be next on their list."

This scenario provides a mix of dialogue, action, and decision-making that should engage the party and deepen the intrigue of your campaign, highlighting the perilous nature of dealing with the Shadow Group and the volatile dynamics within Clan Tanithil.
