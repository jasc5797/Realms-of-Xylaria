The party can decide what to do next but in the end they will be tracked down the Master Servant, [[Isvar Zunil]], of [[Clan Trisfir]] who is secretly also the spy master for the family. He should take them into custody for interrogation with a zone of truth. He is mischievous and shouldn't be taken at face value, which he plays off things with a rye humor. He will take a liking to the party if things go well. He will slap them around a bit, but once proven innocent he will let them free. On there way out he will summon them to his office and offer to hire them on to investigate the group behind the attack. He should show them a scrap of the same symbol from the [[Unknown Letter]] that was taken from the wreckage of the explosion. Eventually he will let them free and even let them keep their accommodations and an additional stipend as long as they agree to help him investigate the secret group.

# Fleeing the scene of the crime 

Chase scene throughout the city. Maybe make this a group ability check, but eventually the party should be captured 

# Interrogation 

## Interrogation Cells

Maybe they are initially interrogated separately at first, but eventually they will be brought into a single room for a zone of truth. This is where [[Isvar Zunil]] would come in.

## Talking with [[Isvar Zunil]]

[[Isvar Zunil]] should have some dirt on each of the characters. This should include details about when each player character made it to the city and any dirt that could be dug up by [[Isvar Zunil]]'s large spy network

### [[Edwin Ravenswood]]
- [[Isvar Zunil]] is aware of [[House Ravenswood]] and its fall
- He hints that it was tragic that they ruffled the wrong feathers in [[Etral Kingdom]]
- He is confused about Eddie though and believes that he must have stolen [[Edwin Ravenswood]]'s identity since [[Edwin Ravenswood]] has been report missing in any queries

### [[Gnutz Snatcher]]
- [[Isvar Zunil]] says he is not sure of [[Gnutz Snatcher]] but guesses he comes from a tragic backstory of his village being destroyed in a raid. In reality he knows that [[Ozai]] leader of the [[Veilbound Syndicate]] was the true perpetrator of those raids as a way to make the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] look bad 

### [[John-Boy Blackthorne]]
- [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] is a bit of an enigma to [[Isvar Zunil]]
- His name shows up in snippets across different kingdoms ranging over many years with almost as many reports of death. [[Isvar Zunil]] assumes it must be some poetic name that ruffians with a death wish take on 

### [[Miera Ashglade]]
- [[Isvar Zunil]] is aware of [[House Ashglade]]'s troubles and the tragic story of a run away girl and her angered betrothed that still hunts for her.


[[Isvar Zunil]] talks about how sad it is that the party's newly acquired house and their employment have meet such an explosive end. He does however have an offer that may pique their interests. He says that the royal family is willing to hire them on, considering they are now free agents and all, to loyal serve as a group to perform special interests where the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] can normal reach. In exchange the party's connection with the bombing won't be spread through the news tomorrow. To sweeten the deal he says they can keep their current lodgings and will have an increased payment scheme.

# Warehouse


Plan for infiltration of a [[Clan Tanithil]] warehouse. [Battle Map](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmaps/comments/rv70f1/warehouse_31x18/)
The party has been to this warehouse before so knows its layout
### **1. Preparation and Reconnaissance**

**Objective**: Gather information about the warehouse and its security.

- **Initial Intelligence**:
    - **Gather Intel**: Use streetwise or local contacts to learn about the warehouse's layout, guards, and any recent activities. Look for potential weak points in security.
    - **Surveillance**: Observe the warehouse from a distance to understand guard routines, patrol patterns, and any unusual activities.

### **2. Infiltration Plan**

**Objective**: Enter the warehouse stealthily and locate the needed clues.

- **Disguise and Entry**:
    
    - **Disguises**: The party could use disguises to blend in with warehouse staff or guards. Alternatively, they might use a magical means of concealment or invisibility.
    - **Access Points**: Identify and use less-guarded entry points like a side door or roof access. If needed, create a diversion to draw attention away from the main entrance.
- **Navigating the Warehouse**:
    
    - **Guard Patrols**: Pay attention to guard schedules and avoid detection. Use stealth and make use of shadows and cover.
    - **Mapping the Warehouse**: Create a mental or physical map of the interior to locate key areas such as storage rooms, offices, and any potential hidden sections.

### **3. Searching for Clues**

**Objective**: Find the symbol and any other evidence connecting the warehouse to the explosion and the shadowy group.

- **Symbol Matching**:
    
    - **Locate Symbol**: Search for the symbol matching the one the party found previously. Look for it on documents, crates, or hidden compartments.
    - **Document Examination**: Search for any correspondence, ledgers, or items that could reveal connections to the shadowy group or the explosive incident.
- **Interrogation and Discoveries**:
    
    - **Interrogation**: If the party encounters any guards or warehouse staff, they might need to use persuasion or intimidation to extract information.
    - **Hidden Secrets**: Look for secret rooms or hidden caches that might contain critical evidence.

### **4. Escape and Report**

**Objective**: Exit the warehouse safely and report findings to Isver.

- **Safe Exit**:
    
    - **Avoid Detection**: As the party leaves, they should avoid alerting additional guards or drawing attention.
    - **Escape Routes**: Have a plan for a quick exit, including possible disguises or alternate routes if things go awry.
- **Reporting**:
    
    - **Deliver Findings**: Provide Isver with all gathered evidence, including the symbol and any documents or items linking Clan Tanithil to the explosion.

### **5. Encounter with Shadowy Group**

**Objective**: Prepare for potential encounters or follow-up leads.

- **Potential Confrontation**: Be prepared for a confrontation with the shadowy group if their presence is uncovered during the infiltration.
- **Clues to Follow Up**: Use any new information to follow leads and further investigate the shadowy groupâ€™s motives and connections.

This plan provides a structured approach for the party to in


# Further investigation 

Some hint or clue should be found during the warehouse infiltration, that details a secret rendezvous that is supposed to happen with the shadow group that evening. The party should be pressed for time on when the meeting occurs and should be tempted to spy on the rendezvous. However this is a trap, as the shadow group knows the warehouse was compromised, and/or the secret group has strong enemies for the party to fight. This should be tough fight where the city guards under [[Isvar Zunil]] could serve as a deus ex machina here as needed
