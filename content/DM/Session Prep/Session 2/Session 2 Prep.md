# Rough Plan

The party can decide what to do next but in the end they will be tracked down the Master Servant, [[Isvar Zunil]], of [[Clan Trisfir]] who is secretly also the spy master for the family. He should take them into custody for interrogation with a zone of truth. He is mischievous and shouldn't be taken at face value, which he plays off things with a rye humor. He will take a liking to the party if things go well. He will slap them around a bit, but once proven innocent he will let them free. On there way out he will summon them to his office and offer to hire them on to investigate the group behind the attack. He should show them a scrap of the same symbol from the [[Unknown Letter]] that was taken from the wreckage of the explosion. Eventually he will let them free and even let them keep their accommodations and an additional stipend as long as they agree to help him investigate the secret group.

# Plan
## Fleeing the scene of the crime 

Some sort of chase scene throughout the city. Let the party go their own course and make them do group ability check accordingly. However, eventually the party will be captured.

### Initial Setup: The Aftermath of the Explosion

- **Immediate Reactions:** Start with the explosion's shockwave, debris flying, and the general chaos that ensues. Have people screaming, dust settling, and guards rushing to secure the area. The party may not yet know if [[High Chieftess]] [[Asina Trisfir]] is alive, adding to their confusion and tension.
- **Suspicion Falls on the Party:** Perhaps the party notices guards pointing in their direction or hears whispers from nearby citizens. They might recall that they were tasked with placing an object close to the parade, realizing it could have been a bomb. Give them time to react before guards move in.

### Encouraging a Chase Scene

- **Opportunity to Escape:** Describe guards closing in, giving the party a split-second decision on whether to flee or stay. Most players may instinctively try to run. If they choose to flee, you can engage them in a chase sequence. Make it clear that there are multiple patrols scattered throughout Sylmare, so it won't be an easy escape.
- **Skill Challenges:** Run a skill challenge where each player describes their character’s actions to avoid capture. Some examples:
    - **Athletics/Acrobatics:** For climbing or darting through alleys and narrow streets.
    - **Stealth:** For hiding in the chaos or blending in with crowds.
    - **Deception/Performance:** To throw off the guards with distractions or disguises.
    - **Perception/Insight:** To spot patrols or figure out the guards’ search patterns.
- Success gives them more time to plan, while failures mean more guards are closing in.
- See [[2.1 Festival of the Moon Escape Options]] for more in depth scenarios and mechanics

### Alternative Options for the Party

If your party is creative or unpredictable, they might try some of the following:

1. **Hiding in the City:** They might try to lay low in different parts of Sylmare, perhaps seeking refuge in known NPCs like [[Chak-tha]] or [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]]’s shops. This could create some roleplay moments where NPCs offer them advice or try to help, adding an investigative feel.
2. **Surrendering or Talking Their Way Out:** Some players might try to surrender or talk their way out immediately. The guards could be suspicious, but a successful persuasion or insight check might give them more leniency, allowing them to be taken in peacefully.
3. **Splitting the Party:** If the group decides to split up, you can introduce smaller encounters where individuals try to outwit the guards, but ultimately lead them back together for capture.
4. **Seeking Help from the Crowd:** The party might appeal to the citizens, creating distractions or false leads to evade the guards temporarily. However, [[Sylmare]]’s citizens might still be wary due to the explosion, making it harder to gain trust.

### Final Capture

No matter their choices, you can slowly tighten the noose by introducing more guards, magical detection spells, or setting up blockades throughout the city. After a series of skill checks or short encounters, the guards eventually corner them. The capture can be dramatic:

- **Magical Capture:** Perhaps the guards use spells like _Hold Person_, _Web_, or _Sleep_ to subdue the party.
- **Physical Overpowering:** If the party resists too much, make it clear that elite units or enforcers are called in, overwhelming them.
- **NPC Interference:** You could introduce an NPC that the party knows (like [[Isvar Zunil]], the royal family's spy master) to make the capture feel planned, hinting at the interrogation to come.

### Interrogation and Exoneration

Once captured, the party is brought in for questioning. [[Isvar Zunil]] could interrogate them, piecing together their involvement with the [[Clan Tanithil]]’s plot. This sets up their eventual exoneration as they prove their innocence and begin investigating who orchestrated the explosion.

## Interrogation 

### Interrogation Cells

Maybe they are initially interrogated separately at first, but eventually they will be brought into a single room for a zone of truth. This is where [[Isvar Zunil]] would come in.

See [[2.2 Isvar's Interrogation]] for more information and dialogue.

### Magical Artifacts for Hunting the Party

1. **Ensnaring Bolas**
    
    - **Description:** These bolas are enchanted to automatically ensnare a target on contact, summoning magical vines or chains to bind them.
    - **Effect:** On a successful ranged attack, the target must make a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. The vines or chains are incredibly durable and resist simple cutting.
2. **Seeker Lantern**
    
    - **Description:** A magical lantern that, when lit, emits a beam of light that points toward the nearest magical signature or entity that is trying to hide (including the party).
    - **Effect:** The light automatically illuminates invisible or hiding creatures within 60 feet, making it hard for the party to escape by stealth or illusion magic.
3. **Sonic Net**
    
    - **Description:** This enchanted net emits a deafening sonic pulse when thrown, disorienting and slowing down anyone caught in its radius.
    - **Effect:** When thrown, the net explodes with sound in a 10-foot radius. All creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 round, and the net automatically restrains its target.
4. **Arcane Manacles**
    
    - **Description:** These manacles are enchanted to suppress the magical abilities of any spellcasters they restrain.
    - **Effect:** While wearing these manacles, the target cannot cast spells or use magical abilities, and they cannot teleport or escape magically. They may also reduce the target's Strength score for non-casters, weakening their ability to break free.
5. **Divination Eye**
    
    - **Description:** A floating orb used by [[Sylmare]]’s guards, the Divination Eye patrols the streets, recording everything it sees and feeding information directly to the guard captain.
    - **Effect:** The eye can hover up to 100 feet away from its user and is equipped with _True Sight_ and _Detect Magic_. It can also emit a _Blinding Ray_ (DC 14 Constitution save or be blinded for 1 minute).

### Magical Interrogation Techniques by Isvar Zunil

Isvar Zunil would likely use both psychological pressure and magical methods to extract information from the party. He has a meticulous and calculated approach, playing on their fears while leveraging powerful magic.

#### Non-Magical Interrogation Techniques

1. **Cold, Distant Approach**: Isvar may use silence and observation to make the party uneasy. He would sit in silence for long periods, watching their body language and waiting for them to crack or speak without prompting.
    
2. **False Evidence**: He might present fake evidence or misleading information that makes the party think they’ve been incriminated further, sowing doubt among the group.
    
3. **Good Cop, Bad Cop**: Isvar could present himself as a cold, calculating interrogator, then have a "sympathetic" NPC enter the room to offer a seemingly better deal if they confess or provide information.
    
4. **Isolation**: Separating party members and feeding them conflicting information. He may interrogate them one at a time, creating paranoia by implying that one of them has betrayed the others.
    

#### Magical Interrogation Techniques

1. **Zone of Truth**
    
    - **Spell:** As expected, **Zone of Truth** (2nd level) would be a common technique for Isvar. It compels truth-telling within a 15-foot radius sphere.
    - **Effect:** The party members must make a Charisma saving throw, or they cannot knowingly lie. Isvar would use this to ask pointed questions about their involvement in the explosion.
2. **Mind Spike**
    
    - **Spell:** **Mind Spike** (2nd level) allows Isvar to reach into the mind of a target, causing psychic damage and learning their location if they try to escape. He could use it to weaken their mental resolve.
    - **Effect:** A failed save means the party member takes psychic damage and cannot hide their location from Isvar for up to an hour.
3. **Detect Thoughts**
    
    - **Spell:** **Detect Thoughts** (2nd level) would allow Isvar to read surface-level thoughts during interrogation, revealing key details the party might not want to share.
    - **Effect:** After reading their surface thoughts, Isvar could push deeper, forcing a Wisdom save. If the party fails, he gains access to their deeper thoughts and fears, potentially learning critical information.
4. **Symbol of Pain**
    
    - **Artifact:** Isvar might place a **Symbol of Pain** in the room or on the table. This magical rune, when activated, causes intense pain to all creatures within its radius unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw.
    - **Effect:** While in its presence, the party members suffer disadvantage on Constitution and Charisma saves due to the overwhelming pain, weakening their mental and physical defenses during questioning.
5. **Mirror of False Truths**
    
    - **Artifact:** This enchanted mirror shows the reflection of the person being interrogated but twists their face into a mask of guilt. Isvar can use it to create a psychological effect, as the party sees themselves confessing to the crime in the reflection.
    - **Effect:** When used, it forces a Wisdom saving throw, or the target begins to doubt their own innocence, becoming more pliable in the interrogation.
6. **Fleshbind Shackles**
    
    - **Artifact:** These shackles are enchanted to prevent the wearer from resisting magic. Any spells cast on the target while they wear the shackles have disadvantage on saving throws.
    - **Effect:** Isvar could use these shackles during interrogations to weaken their defenses against his spells like **Zone of Truth**, **Detect Thoughts**, or **Mind Spike**.

### Talking with [[Isvar Zunil]]

[[Isvar Zunil]] should have some dirt on each of the characters. This should include details about when each player character made it to the city and any dirt that could be dug up by [[Isvar Zunil]]'s large spy network

### [[Edwin Ravenswood]]
- [[Isvar Zunil]] is aware of [[House Ravenswood]] and its fall
- He hints that it was tragic that they ruffled the wrong feathers in [[Etral Kingdom]]
- He is confused about Eddie though and believes that he must have stolen [[Edwin Ravenswood]]'s identity since [[Edwin Ravenswood]] has been report missing in any queries

### [[Gnutz Snatcher]]
- [[Isvar Zunil]] says he is not sure of [[Gnutz Snatcher]] but guesses he comes from a tragic backstory of his village being destroyed in a raid. In reality he knows that [[Ozai]] leader of the [[Veilbound Syndicate]] was the true perpetrator of those raids as a way to make the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] look bad 

### [[John-Boy Blackthorne]]
- [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] is a bit of an enigma to [[Isvar Zunil]]
- His name shows up in snippets across different kingdoms ranging over many years with almost as many reports of death. [[Isvar Zunil]] assumes it must be some poetic name that ruffians with a death wish take on 

### [[Miera Ashglade]]
- [[Isvar Zunil]] is aware of [[House Ashglade]]'s troubles and the tragic story of a run away girl and her angered betrothed that still hunts for her.


[[Isvar Zunil]] talks about how sad it is that the party's newly acquired house and their employment have meet such an explosive end. He does however have an offer that may pique their interests. He says that the royal family is willing to hire them on, considering they are now free agents and all, to loyal serve as a group to perform special interests where the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] can normal reach. In exchange the party's connection with the bombing won't be spread through the news tomorrow. To sweeten the deal he says they can keep their current lodgings and will have an increased payment scheme. He asks the party to infiltrate on of [[Clan Tanithil]]'s warehouses that the party is already familiar with in order to find more information on the [[Shadow Group]] 

See [[2.3 Getting acquainted with Isvar]] for more information on next steps for the party.

## Warehouse


Plan for infiltration of a [[Clan Tanithil]] warehouse. [Battle Map](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmaps/comments/rv70f1/warehouse_31x18/)
The party has been to this warehouse before so knows its layout

See [[2.4 Infiltrating Clan Tanithil's Warehouse]] for more information.
### **1. Preparation and Reconnaissance**

**Objective**: Gather information about the warehouse and its security.

- **Initial Intelligence**:
    - **Gather Intel**: Use streetwise or local contacts to learn about the warehouse's layout, guards, and any recent activities. Look for potential weak points in security.
    - **Surveillance**: Observe the warehouse from a distance to understand guard routines, patrol patterns, and any unusual activities.

### **2. Infiltration Plan**

**Objective**: Enter the warehouse stealthily and locate the needed clues.

- **Disguise and Entry**:
    
    - **Disguises**: The party could use disguises to blend in with warehouse staff or guards. Alternatively, they might use a magical means of concealment or invisibility.
    - **Access Points**: Identify and use less-guarded entry points like a side door or roof access. If needed, create a diversion to draw attention away from the main entrance.
- **Navigating the Warehouse**:
    
    - **Guard Patrols**: Pay attention to guard schedules and avoid detection. Use stealth and make use of shadows and cover.
    - **Mapping the Warehouse**: Create a mental or physical map of the interior to locate key areas such as storage rooms, offices, and any potential hidden sections.

### **3. Searching for Clues**

**Objective**: Find the symbol and any other evidence connecting the warehouse to the explosion and the shadowy group.

- **Symbol Matching**:
    
    - **Locate Symbol**: Search for the symbol matching the one the party found previously. Look for it on documents, crates, or hidden compartments.
    - **Document Examination**: Search for any correspondence, ledgers, or items that could reveal connections to the shadowy group or the explosive incident.
- **Interrogation and Discoveries**:
    
    - **Interrogation**: If the party encounters any guards or warehouse staff, they might need to use persuasion or intimidation to extract information.
    - **Hidden Secrets**: Look for secret rooms or hidden caches that might contain critical evidence.

### **4. Escape and Report**

**Objective**: Exit the warehouse safely and report findings to Isver.

- **Safe Exit**:
    
    - **Avoid Detection**: As the party leaves, they should avoid alerting additional guards or drawing attention.
    - **Escape Routes**: Have a plan for a quick exit, including possible disguises or alternate routes if things go awry.
- **Reporting**:
    
    - **Deliver Findings**: Provide Isver with all gathered evidence, including the symbol and any documents or items linking Clan Tanithil to the explosion.

### **5. Encounter with Shadowy Group**

**Objective**: Prepare for potential encounters or follow-up leads.

- **Potential Confrontation**: Be prepared for a confrontation with the shadowy group if their presence is uncovered during the infiltration.
- **Clues to Follow Up**: Use any new information to follow leads and further investigate the shadowy group’s motives and connections.

This plan provides a structured approach for the party to in


# Further investigation 

Some hint or clue should be found during the warehouse infiltration, that details a secret rendezvous that is supposed to happen with the shadow group that evening. The party should be pressed for time on when the meeting occurs and should be tempted to spy on the rendezvous. However this is a trap, as the shadow group knows the warehouse was compromised, and/or the secret group has strong enemies for the party to fight. This should be tough fight where the city guards under [[Isvar Zunil]] could serve as a deus ex machina here as needed
