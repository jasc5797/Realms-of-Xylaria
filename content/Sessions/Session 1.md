# Start

> Today is the day of the [[Festival of the Moon]], a long standing tradition in the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] to honor their God, [[The Great Elk of the Forest]], and to commemorate the kingdoms founding. The festival only happens once in every 16 years, lining up with a solar eclipse that reaches it apex over [[Sylmare]]. This eclipse has every occurred 16 years at exactly noon like clock work over the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] as far as recorded history, and even continues after [[The Convergence]]. On this day the [[High Chieftess]], [[Asina Trisfir]], along with her family and other notable members of the [[Clans of Trisfir]] travel to a hidden grove on the mainland outside of [[Sylmare]]. Here they perform a sacred ritual to honor the place in which the founding of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] occurred thousands of years ago when the warlord [[Asin Trisfir]], the leader of [[Clan Trisfir]], forced the Chiefs of the other clans to swear loyalty to the newly birthed [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. During the whole day the city erupts with celebrations, and peoples from far and wide fill the city to partake in the revelry.  A large fireworks show takes place during the eclipse. Many shops stay open at this time to try to cash in on the influx of people. On top of these vendors line many streets across the cities selling a wide verity of trinkets and street food. The [[Festival of the Moon]] is known for having a spectacular view of the eclipse itself, and also for continuing the festivities long into the night. However, another main event is the parade of the [[High Chieftess]] through the city with her  entourage returning to from the grove a few hours after the eclipse. Many line the streets to catch even the slightest of glimpses of [[Asina Trisfir]] as she passes through the streets of [[Sylmare]].

> Currently your party has some downtime as trade and work has slowed down for [[Clan Tanithil]] during the [[Festival of the Moon]]. However your steward, [[Emelden]], has asked that you keep your schedule clear after the eclipse incase of any last minute jobs that come up. In the meantime your party is free to explore [[Sylmare]] and the [[Festival of the Moon]]. 

> You all start your day at your newly acquired base of operations courtesy of [[Clan Tanithil]]. While the interior is still spartan, the living space and clean and even spacious in comparison to the temporary lodgings you have all come accustomed to over the past few months in [[Sylmare]]. The top floor has four bedrooms and a bathroom, while the ground floor has a kitchen with a small pantry, a dining area, and a cramped room that could be a study. Your party currently has the bare minimum for furniture in the house, mostly totaling up to enough beds for each of you as well as a rickety dining table with equally rickety chairs. A few magical artifacts are scattered around the house to provide what is consider modern amenities in [[Sylmare]]. The building itself is two stories and like many buildings in [[Sylmare]] is carved directly into the stone of the stump. The building is made up of smooth carved stone walls and floors in a variety of colors with intricate reliefs on its surface depicting leaves and vines. On top of this the entire building is overflowing with naturally greenery.

**Examples**

Let the party explore the house. All of the amenities utilize the crystals from the [[Kut'al Conclave]] and mechanics of the [[Gearspark Dominion]] to function as well the power of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. These amenities include working lights, running heated water, and an ice box.

Before the party leaves a leaf grows out of a rune inscribed vine along the wall next to the door. The leaf is folded down the middle hiding its contents. The outside of the leaf has [[Edwin Ravenswood]] and [[Miera Ashglade]]'s names on it. Once open the inside is inscribed with a letter from [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]] saying to meet him at his shop as he has heard some news they may be interested in.

When the party goes outside talk about the city streets architecture and the bustle of excited people on the streets. They live in an area that over looks a large portion of the city. The city is alive with people lining the streets for celebrations
