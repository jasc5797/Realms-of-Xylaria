# Start of the Day

> Today is the day of the [[Festival of the Moon]], a long standing tradition in the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] to honor their God, [[The Great Elk of the Forest]], and to commemorate the kingdoms founding. The festival only happens once in every 16 years, lining up with a total solar eclipse that reaches it apex over [[Sylmare]]. This eclipse has every occurred 16 years at exactly noon like clock work over the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] as far as recorded history, and even continues after [[The Convergence]]. On this day the [[High Chieftess]], [[Asina Trisfir]], along with her family and other notable members of the [[Clans of Trisfir]] travel to a hidden grove on the mainland outside of [[Sylmare]]. Here they perform a sacred ritual to honor the place in which the founding of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] occurred thousands of years ago when the warlord [[Asin Trisfir]], the leader of [[Clan Trisfir]], forced the Chiefs of the other clans to swear loyalty to the newly birthed [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. During the whole day the city erupts with celebrations, and peoples from far and wide fill the city to partake in the revelry. Some magical effect prolongs the length of the total eclipse, and during this time a large fireworks show takes place. Many shops stay open at this time to try to cash in on the influx of people. On top of these vendors line many streets across the cities selling a wide verity of trinkets and street food. The [[Festival of the Moon]] is renowned on [[Aosa]] for having a spectacular view of the eclipse, and also for the festivities that last long into the night. On top of this the parade of the [[High Chieftess]] through the city with her entourage returning a few hours after the eclipse brings peoples from far and wide to [[Sylmare]]. Many line the streets to catch even the slightest of glimpses of [[Asina Trisfir]] as she passes through the streets of the city.

> Currently your party has some downtime as trade and work has slowed down for [[Clan Tanithil]] during the [[Festival of the Moon]]. However your steward, [[Emelden Tanithil]], has asked that you keep your schedule clear after the eclipse incase of any last minute jobs that come up. In the meantime your party is free to explore [[Sylmare]] and the [[Festival of the Moon]]. 

> You all start your day at your newly acquired base of operations courtesy of [[Clan Tanithil]]. While the interior is still spartan, the living space and clean and even spacious in comparison to the temporary lodgings you have all come accustomed to over the past few months in [[Sylmare]]. The top floor has four bedrooms and a bathroom, while the ground floor has a kitchen with a small pantry, a dining area, and a cramped room that could be a study. Your party currently has the bare minimum for furniture in the house, mostly totaling up to enough beds for each of you as well as a rickety dining table with equally rickety chairs. A few magical artifacts are scattered around the house to provide what is consider modern amenities in [[Sylmare]]. These amenities include working lights, heated water, an ice box, and a fantasy K-Cup machine. All of which utilize the crystals from the [[Kut'al Conclave]] and mechanics of the [[Gearspark Dominion]] to function as well the power of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. 

>The building itself is two stories and like many buildings in [[Sylmare]] is carved directly into the stone of the stump. The building is made up of smooth carved stone walls and floors in a variety of colors with intricate reliefs on its surface depicting leaves and vines. On top of this the entire building is overflowing with natural greenery.


The party all gets up in their own time, and perform their morning routines. [[Edwin Ravenswood]] and [[Miera Ashglade]] want to go into the city during the [[Festival of the Moon]], and convince [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] to tag along. However before they leave a leaf grows out of a rune inscribed vine that grows along the frame of the front door. The leaf is folded down its center line, hiding its top side. The outside of leaf is inscribed with the names [[Edwin Ravenswood]] and [[Miera Ashglade]]. The inside is inscribed with a letter from [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]] saying to meet him at his shop as he has heard some news they may be interested in. Most of the party decides to head to [[Wobblesproket's Wonders]] to talk with [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]], however [[Gnutz Snatcher]] instead goes his own way to explore the [[Festival of the Moon]] from afar. 


When the party goes outside talk about the city streets architecture and the bustle of excited people on the streets. They live in an area that over looks a large portion of the city. The city is alive with people lining the streets for celebrations

# [[Festival of the Moon]] Key Points 

- [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]] warns the party that a group baring the same sigil as the one found on the [[Unknown Letter]] were reported around town trying to purchase alchemical components that are common for use in fireworks and explosives.
- [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] and [[Gnutz Snatcher]] face off in an archery contest, although [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] has to pay a bribe to compete with a pistol instead of a bow. Here they must hit progressively harder targets in each round. The first round the targets are floating illusions of the full moon, while subsequent rounds the moons are further away and beginning to wane. [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] and [[Gnutz Snatcher]] end up being the final two competitors in the last round of the contest which takes place during the total eclipse. [[Gnutz Snatcher]] ends up taking the prize as [[John-Boy Blackthorne|John-Boy Blackthorne's]] pistol jams. [[Gnutz Snatcher]] wins a leather archery bracer that increase the distance of ranged attacks by 5ft.
- The party is unable to spot anything off about the fireworks show.
- The party returns home after the eclipse
- [[Emelden Tanithil]] eventually meets the party at their home. He is a sloppy half elf who appears to be middle aged. He has a bit of a beer belly and his cloths are a little stained. He asks if it is okay to have a smoke. He pulls out a pipe a snuffbox of pipeweed. He packs the pipe, but instead of lighting the pipeweed he takes a toke on the pipe. This causes runes from the [[Kut'al Conclave]] to begin to glow on the outside of the bowl and the consequently the pipeweed begins to burn. Then he tells them that some plans fell through and a shipment cart that was supposed to make it out of the city before the parade have not left yet, and the crew is no where to be found. He asks that they bring it up the main thoroughfare to a way point so that it can be picked up later as soon as the streets clear out. He tells them about an alley that they can store the cart relatively safely. When he is leaving he also recommends a spot they can go to from the alley for a good view of the parade
- When the party arrives at the [[Clan Tanithil]] warehouse they are suspicious of the contents of the cart, but decide to wait to get away warehouse before checking it out.
- On there way to the drop off point they are stopped by a band of cutpurses, made up of eight gruff looking bandits. The party is able to take down all of the bandits.
- The party investigates the wagon for anything suspicious. [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] is able to cut the ropes tying the cover of the wagon. He finds that the wagon is full of wood crates. He begins to pray them open only to find random supplies, like cookware, paper, ink, bolts, armor, etc. Finding nothing out of the ordinary he decides to seal up the wagon to make it look like it was never opened.
- The party is able to make it to the drop off point with only a few minutes to spare. They decide to go to the spot that [[Emelden Tanithil]] has recommended.
- While the parade passes by the alleyway [[Miera Ashglade]] is able to spot a soft glow appearing around the wagon as it explodes disorienting the whole party. [[Miera Ashglade]] was able to catch a glimpse of some sort of magic go up around the parade right before the explosion hits.
