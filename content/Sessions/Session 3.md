# [[Session 2]] Recap

> The party quickly determined a course of action to try to avoid being captured by the guards of [[Sylmare]] following the attack on the parade during the [[Festival of the Moon]]. The party was able to navigate the city and evade capture for most of the afternoon into dusk. As time went on the city went into lockdown implementing a strict curfew in order to clear the streets. The party decided to try to find [[Emelden Tanithil]] in order to find out what exactly went down with the wagon. However, before they can make it there they are intercepted by some guards. To try to avoid confrontation with the guards  [[Gnutz Snatcher]] used disguise self to blend in with the guards and [[Miera Ashglade]] used charm on the leader of these guards. However, it is revealed that the guards have descriptions of each person in the party. Although they attempt to escape they are eventually surrounded and brought up towards the royal palace. When approaching the palace they were all blind folded and brought to a subterranean dungeon and left overnight. In the morning they were awoken by [[Isvar Zunil]] who questions the party on their involvement with the attack. Eventually the party is exonerated, however [[Isvar Zunil]] was not done with the party. Instead he offers to hire them on to perform tasks under the radar. Their first task was to infiltrate the [[Clan Tanithil]] warehouse that the wagon came from. This warehouse also housed the office for [[Emelden Tanithil]]. They were able to make it into the warehouse undisturbed as they recognized a few friendly faces among the guards, that they meet on previous jobs. The party quickly sets into interrogating [[Emelden Tanithil]] who told them that he does not know much about the organization that put him up to this, but his cousin [[Zukar Tanithil]] is the one who initially put him into contact with the organization. Before they can question him more he is assassinated by an arrow to the chest shot by a figure in red armor. The party tries to follow the figure, but realize that the bottom floor of the warehouse is ablaze. The party scrambles to investigate the office before the fire consumes the room. In a hidden drawer they find two notes with seals matching the seal on the [[Unknown Letter]]. The first letter lays the groundwork for the attack on the parade, with most of the details already familiar for the party. However the second details a deal where this organization can use the warehouse for its operations. The party escapes out a window and make it back to the street, only to find a group of cultists escaping out of the front of the warehouse

# Session Log

## Warehouse Inferno and the Cultist Escape

### The Warehouse Ablaze
The party attempts to stop some cultists from fleeing the warehouse, which is now engulfed in flames. In the chaos, they engage the cultists in the streets. [[Gnutz Snatcher]] tries to grapple one of the fleeing cultists, but the rope he uses snaps, allowing the cultist to escape briefly. [[Edwin Ravenswood]] turns all but one cultists to dust with *Fireball*

### Capture and Interrogation
After a heated skirmish, the party successfully captures one cultist alive. Once his hood is removed, it reveals an [[Exan Elf]] male. Despite initial resistance, [[John-Boy Blackthorne]] intimidates the cultist into talking.

The cultist reveals:
- The cult was aware of the party's arrival and attempted to burn evidence before being caught.
- His fellow cultists escaped into the underground, mocking the party's chances of finding them.
- He speaks fanatically about the [[Pale Hand]], claiming it is the one true god destined to "cull the world of non-believers." He identifies his group as the [[Order of the Pale Hand]].

The party hands the cultist over to the city guard, hoping he reaches [[Isvar Zunil]].

## Meeting Elvi Zunil

### A Chance Encounter
On their way to find a dive bar to get some much needed relaxation, the party is intercepted by an [[Exan Elf]] woman named [[Elvi Zunil|Elvi]]. She introduces herself as an operative working for [[Isvar Zunil]] and expresses interest in hearing what transpired at the warehouse. 

Hearing of their desire for a drink, [[Elvi Zunil]] suggests heading to her favorite spot, [[Moon Maiden's Tavern]].

### At the Moon Maiden's Tavern
At the tavern, [[Elvi Zunil]] is warmly welcomed by [[Helga]], the barkeep, who directs the party to a private hall. Using an amulet shaped like a miniature door—[[Isvar's Amulet of Magnificent Mansion]]—[[Elvi Zunil]] opens a secret space for their discussion.

#### Sharing Information
The party recounts the events of the warehouse, and [[Elvi Zunil]] shares the following:
- [[Zukar Tanithil]] may have connections to the [[Order of the Pale Hand]] and can be found in his mansion.
- Her operatives tracked the cultists into the underground.
- She recalls a cold case involving the [[Order of the Pale Hand]], where a local priest attempting to proselytize was murdered.

#### Future Plans
- The party is tasked with investigating [[Zukar Tanithil]].
- [[Elvi Zunil]]'s operatives will continue tracking the cultists underground.
- [[Isvar Zunil]] contacts [[Elvi Zunil]] through sending stones during the discussion. The party asks if they can obtain sending stones, and [[Elvi Zunil]] promises to check.

## The Thirsty Goat and New Leads

### A Visit to The Thirsty Goat
The party heads to [[The Thirsty Goat]], a dive bar recommended by [[John-Boy Blackthorne]]. Outside, [[Edwin Ravenswood]] uses prestidigitation to swap the pants colors of two passed-out drunks. Inside, they meet Steve, the bartender, who knows [[John-Boy Blackthorne]].

#### New Information
Steve suggests visiting the underground fighting den, Rolicker’s Rampage, where the barkeep may have more information about the cultists.

### Drunken Antics
The two drunks outside get into a fight over their swapped pants, eventually passing out again with fresh bruises.

## Infiltrating Zukar Tanithil’s Mansion

### Gaining Entry
The party travels to [[Zukar Tanithil]]'s affluent mansion, where he is hosting a soiree in the garden. Disguising themselves as guards, they convince workers to hand over a supply cart, allowing them to sneak into the mansion.

### Searching the Mansion
With the help of [[Gnutz Snatcher]]'s *Pass Without a Trace*, the party sneaks through the mansion:
- They find a locked, magically enchanted door but avoid alerting [[Zukar Tanithil]].
- In [[Zukar Tanithil]]'s bedroom, they discover a hidden key among his undergarments, which unlocks his office.

#### The Office
Despite some mishaps, the party finds:
- [[Zukar's Ledger of Shadows]], encrypted in thieves' cant.
- A deed to a property in the [[Beacon's Watch]] district on [[DM/Session Prep/Session 4/Protector's Point/Protector's Point]].

### Escape
The party escapes unnoticed and returns the cart to the workers.

## Returning Home

Back at their residence, [[Gnutz Snatcher]] discovers a [[Letter from Ozai]] waiting on his bed, hinting at new developments.
