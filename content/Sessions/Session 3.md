# [[Session 2]] Recap

> The party quickly determined a course of action to try to avoid being captured by the guards of [[Sylmare]] following the attack on the parade during the [[Festival of the Moon]]. The party was able to navigate the city and evade capture for most of the afternoon into dusk. As time went on the city went into lockdown implementing a strict curfew in order to clear the streets. The party decided to try to find [[Emelden Tanithil]] in order to find out what exactly went down with the wagon. However, before they can make it there they are intercepted by some guards. To try to avoid confrontation with the guards  [[Gnutz Snatcher]] used disguise self to blend in with the guards and [[Miera Ashglade]] used charm on the leader of these guards. However, it is revealed that the guards have descriptions of each person in the party. Although they attempt to escape they are eventually surrounded and brought up towards the royal palace. When approaching the palace they were all blind folded and brought to a subterrain dungeon and left overnight. In the morning they were awoken by [[Isvar Zunil]] who questions the party on their involvement within the attack. Eventually the party is exonerated, however [[Isvar Zunil]] was not done with the party. Instead he offers to hire them on to perform tasks under the radar. Their first task was to infiltrate the [[Clan Tanithil]] warehouse that the wagon came from. This warehouse also housed the office for [[Emelden Tanithil]]. They were able to make it into the warehouse undisturbed as they recognized a few friendly faces among the guards, that they meet on previous jobs. The party quickly sets into interrogating [[Emelden Tanithil]] who told them that he does not know much about the organization that put him up to this, but his cousin [[Zukar Tanithil]] is the one who initially put him into contact with the organization. Before they can question him more he is assassinated by an arrow to the chest shot by a figure in red armor. The party tries to follow the figure, but realize that the bottom floor of the warehouse is ablaze. The party scrambles to investigate the office before the fire consumes the room. In a hidden drawer they find two notes with seals matching the seal on the [[Unknown Letter]]. The first letter lays the groundwork for the attack on the parade, with most of the details already familiar for the party. However the second details a deal where this organization can use the warehouse for its operations. The party escapes out a window and make it back to the street, only to find a group of cultists escaping out of the front of the warehouse
