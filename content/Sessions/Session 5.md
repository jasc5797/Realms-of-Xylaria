# [[Session 4]] Recap

> The party began their day at their homebase, each waking in their own time, though [[Gnutz Snatcher]] had to be roused by [[Miera Ashglade]]. Near the door, [[Miera]] found a magical leaflet addressed to the group, providing contact information for [[Elvi Zunil]] through the [[Vine Network]]. With a plan to visit [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]] and explore the city for magical goods, the party set off.

> At [[Wobblesprocket's Wonders]], the group encountered [[Boltz]], Horatio’s mechanical assistant, who graciously accepted [[John-Boy Blackthorne]]’s help to oil his joints. [[John-Boy]] commissioned Horatio to craft a pistol, with an additional enchantment for a +1 bonus, promising half payment upfront. Meanwhile, [[Edwin Ravenswood]] secured directions to [[Arcane Quills]] for spell scrolls. There, Edwin purchased a _Scroll of Detect Poison and Disease_ while [[Gnutz Snatcher]] pocketed a _Scroll of Counterspell_ and _Scroll of Detect Magic_ without notice.

> Heeding [[Steve]]’s advice, the party ventured into [[Sylmare]]’s underground to investigate [[Rollicker's Rampage]]. Navigating hidden storm drains under [[John-Boy]]’s guidance, they arrived at the [[Bugbear’s Den]]. Inside, they met [[Glarb]], a bugbear barkeep, who provided directions to [[Rollicker's Rampage]] for a fee. Sampling the local favorite _Anything Ale_, the group briefly stayed to participate in some underground games. [[Edwin Ravenswood]] engaged in a tense match of five-finger fillet but ended in a draw. Not satisfied, the challenge escalated to shooting a bullet mid-air, where [[John-Boy]]’s sharpshooting triumphed. Meanwhile, [[Gnutz Snatcher]] stealthily recovered the wagered gold, leading the opposing gang to leave humiliated and lighter in pockets.

> At [[Rollicker's Rampage]], the party registered for a team match under the name **The Foot of Darkness**. The battle was intense, pitting them against a fierce team of opponents: Lunamore, Theren Balewind, Cetos, and Shavir. Despite a valiant effort by their foes, the party emerged victorious, with only [[Miera Ashglade]] falling unconscious during the fight. The staff revived all combatants, ensuring no lives were lost. The party earned 50 GP each for their win, and [[Miera]] managed to slip Lunamore her contact information, hinting at future interactions.

> After the fight, [[Bob]]—the barkeep at [[Rollicker's Rampage]]—welcomed them with celebratory drinks. When the party broached the topic of the [[Order of the Pale Hand]], his demeanor shifted. In a private room, he warned them about the group’s growing presence and their dangerous reputation. He revealed their signature tattoos and their expulsion from the fight club after a deadly incident. Bob offered to keep the party informed in exchange for their promise to return for another bout in the future.

> The session concluded with the party leveling up, leaving them to recover in the private room.
