# [[Session 1]] Recap

> The party awakens in their new home base within the city of [[Sylmare]] on the day of the [[Festival of the Moon]], a large festival in the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] that occurs on the day of a solar eclipse that happens every 16 years over the city. The party has some free time to explore the festivities, however they have been asked to meet with [[Emelden Tanithil]], a steward of [[Clan Tanithil|Clan Tanithil's]] mercantile company, after the eclipse in case of any last minute jobs. Before leaving their home base [[Edwin Ravenswood]] and [[Miera Ashglade]] receive a leaflet from [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]] saying that he may have found some information they may be interested in. The party enjoy many different attractions and food stalls throughout the city and eventually meet with [[Horatio Wobblesprocket III]]. He tells the party that some group baring the same sigil as the one on the [[Unknown Letter]] have been spotted around the city at different alchemic suppliers looking for components for explosives and fireworks. The party continues on through the festivities and even venture to the lake at the center of the city to watch the fireworks show during the eclipse. Eventually the party returns home to meet with [[Emelden Tanithil]]. He asks the party to transfer a wagon up to a waypoint up the main road of the city. He tells them that it was supposed to have already been moved before the parade, but it was missed. So they must get the wagon up to a transfer point so it can be picked up after the parade. Lastly he tells the party about a spot they can go to after dropping of the wagon to get a good view of the show. The party picks up the wagon, but are suspicious of its contents and the nature of the job. They decide to continue on their way to check it out in a more secluded area. Eventually they are ambushed by a group of cutpurses, but they are easily dispatched. The party decides to take a look at the contents, but do not find anything out of the ordinary, so they continue on their way. They are able to drop the wagon off at the transfer point and continue up to the spot that was recommended by [[Emelden Tanithil]] only to have the wagon explode as the parade with [[Asina Trisfir]] passes by.

# Start

> The party begins to come to their senses as the dust from the explosion begins to settle over the streets of [[Sylmare]]. An eerie silence hangs over the city as everything comes to a halt. Within moments screams and cries echo throughout the city as people scramble to escape the violence. 

# Escaping the guards

> As the dust continues to settle a crush of people begin to form in the street of [[Sylmare]]. The party decides to try to regroup and take a short rest in a secluded alley to figure out their next step. They plan on trying to interrogate [[Emelden Tanithil]] at the warehouse where they picked up the wagon. By the time they end their short rest the sun is begin to set and their is an increased guard presence as they continue to clear the streets. The party is able to continue to sneak through the city, but find themselves blocked by guard checkpoints setup at each of the entrances to higher levels of the city. [[Gnutz Snatcher]] is able to use his magical artifact to summon a spectral arrow that he is able to control to help guide his grappling hook up to a ledge on a terrace of a higher level of the city. Using this the party is able to make their way forward without being caught.

# Fight with the guards

> The sun has fully set at this point and lights from guard patrols litter the city as the party draws nearer to their destination. [[Gnutz Snatcher]] decides to use disguise self to try to act as a guard in case they are approached by any actually patrols. Eventually the party is seen by another passing patrol and are pulled aside for questioning. [[Gnutz Snatcher]] does not know much about the guards of [[Sylmare]] and is unable to convince the patrol to leave them alone. The leader of the guards tells them that after a quick search he will write them a pass to get on their way. Unfortunately for [[Gnutz Snatcher]] the patrol was equipped with lanterns that can dispel minor illusions revealing the bugbear behind the disguise. [[Miera Ashglade]] is able to sooth the perturbed leader of the patrol with a charm spell, however [[Gnutz Snatcher]] is able to overhear one of the other guards say two words "matches description". The party begins to step away as the guards get ready to try to capture them. While a few are caught in the guards traps the party is able to make their way down the street while taking out three guards in the process. However, the party finds themselves almost surrounded as more patrols approach from either end of the street. The Captain of the guard pushes out through the throng of guards that now surround the party, and orders them to drop their arms and stand down. Seeing no other option the party complies and is swiftly taken into custody. Rune inscribed manacles are placed on each member of the party to suppress any magic effects.  The party is marched through the streets of [[Sylmare]], but are blindfolded as the approach the royal palace. The party is lead under ground through a winding maze of corridors and eventually placed into a conjoin jail cell where they are left overnight.

# Interrogation

> The party awakes to someone dragging their staff across bars as they say
> "*Wakey Wakey kids"*
> The party sees a lithe elven male in regal robes who appears to be upper middle aged. He activates the manacles and the party is magically dragged to the back wall of the cell. The elven man enters the cell and introduces himself as [[Isvar Zunil]]. He tells the party the he is here to figure out exactly went down during the parade yesterday, and the party are prime suspects. In a show of force [[Isvar Zunil]] reveals that he has been digging up dirt on each of the members of the party. After which he sets into the interrogation. The party tell [[Isvar Zunil]] about [[Emelden Tanithil]] and how they were setup for the job without knowing what was going to happen. [[Isvar Zunil]] activates a zone of truth in order to verify the party is not lying. Satisfied with their answers, but unsatisfied that he did not have a chance to go further with his interrogation techniques, *cough* *cough* torture, he lets the party of relatively unscathed other than a slap from a mage hand for [[Edwin Ravenswood]] and [[Gnutz Snatcher]]. The party is released and given back their items and are told to follow some guards.

# Talking with [[Isvar Zunil]]

>As they follow [[Edwin Ravenswood]] and [[Gnutz Snatcher]] realize they eventually diverge from the route they were brought in. The party pass through as guard checkpoint into a more lavish part of the complex. They are lead to a large wooden door and inside is a large office space with an equally large desk, chair, and fireplace. As the party enters, [[Isvar Zunil]], turns his chair around to face them as he lounges with his pet cat on his lap. He introduces himself as the [[Master Servant]] of [[Clan Trisfir]]. [[Isvar Zunil]] asks the party to make themselves comfortable in the chairs in front of his desk. He even offers the party tea and alcohol. Eventually he gets down to brass tacks and tells the party about an opportunity the he has for the party. He is upfront that [[Clan Trisfir]] has the major bargaining chip in that they have the power over whether the party's names are spread throughout the city in connection with the attack during the parade. However, he is confident in what he has to offer. He explains that he is not surprised that this attack happened, only that it was so bold. He shows a scrap of cloth taken from the wagon that even through the scorching clearly matches the seal from the [[Unknown Letter]]. He tells the party that the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] has been trying to investigate this group, but they have not been able to get any solid leads. He believes that some of the restrictions that fall on the authority of kingdom hamper their abilities to get anywhere with stopping them. That is where the party comes in, as they can serves an (eventually) elite task force to work on jobs of special interest. He offers their party to continue to live in their current home base that was originally provided by [[Clan Tanithil]]. On top of this he is willing to provide a generous stipend. After some planning with [[Isvar Zunil]] the party decides it is time to track down [[Emelden Tanithil]] at the warehouse.

# Infiltrating the Warehouse

> The party makes their way to the warehouse with unperturbed. However, when they approach the warehouse they notice some familiar faces among the workers and guards that the party has worked with before under the employment of [[Clan Tanithil]]. They play it cool while talking with the guards and are even pointed towards [[Emelden Tanithil]] in his office. The party quickly sets into interrogating [[Emelden Tanithil]] who tells them that he does not know much about the organization that put him up to this, but his cousin [[Zukar Tanithil]] is the one who initially put him into contact with the organization. Before they can question him more he is assassinated by an arrow to the chest shot by a figure in red armor. The party tries to follow the figure, but realize that the bottom floor of the warehouse is ablaze. The party scrambles to investigate the office before the fire consumes the room. In a hidden drawer they find two notes with seals matching the seal on the [[Unknown Letter]]. The first letter lays the groundwork for the attack on the parade, with most of the details already familiar for the party. However the second details a deal where this organization can use the warehouse for its operations. The party escapes out a window and make it back to the street, only to find a group of cultists escaping out of the front of the warehouse
