# Description

This letter was taken from the group who attacked [[Edwin Ravenswood]] and [[Miera Ashglade]] in the streets of [[Dronn]]. Its wax seal bears a sigil of five finger like protrusions reaching upwards from a single point that is centered towards the bottom of the sigil. The envelop of the letter has no other identifying markers. The letter itself is not addressed to anyone in particular, however it does contain details about both the [[Orb of Eternity]] and the [[Trademaster's Ring]]. It also says that these items can be identified by looking for an engraving on the item that matches the sigil on the envelop. The letter continues with descriptions of [[Edwin Ravenswood]] and [[Miera Ashglade]], and requests that these items are tracked down and taken by any means necessary. There is no signature at the bottom of the letter.
