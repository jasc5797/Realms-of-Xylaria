# Welcome to the [[Realms of Xylaria]]!

This is a homebrew campaign I've cooked up with some ideas I've been tooling around with, as well as heavy doses of inspiration (*cough* *cough* stealing) from other sources. I'm excited to try my hand at running a full homebrew campaign for you all now that I have some actual DM experience under my belt! With that in mind, please bear with me while we figure this new campaign out.

### Setting the Tone

I'd like to start by saying that I'm aiming for a slightly more serious atmosphere for this campaign. I have some ambitious ideas that I would love to try, but I believe with a little investment from all of us we can really make an expansive and entertaining campaign that we can all enjoy. I do want to clarify that when I say "serious," I mean being focused on playing the game and engaging with the story, rather than having meaning having serious player characters. The tone of your party is entirely up to you once we begin. My hope is that the more we immerse ourselves in the game, the deeper we can explore this campaign's potential. Ultimately, I hope we all enjoy whatever bullshit we inevitably get into!

### A Collaborative Experience

I would appreciate your collaboration in making this a group effort. This story is as much yours to tell as it is mine. At the beginning, I'd like to work with each of you individually on creating your characters and developing a bit of their backstories. I'd also encourage your characters to have some existing relationships with other party members or even non-player characters and factions. The more you can share with me upfront, the more I can tailor the campaign to create an enjoyable experience for everyone. Since this is a homebrew campaign, I'm more than willing to work with you to integrate your ideas into what I have planned for the campaign so far.

### Custom Magic Items

Normally, I would allow players to start with a basic magical item. However, since this is a homebrew campaign, I thought it would be fun for everyone to begin with a custom magical item. I'll work with each of you to create magical items that suit your characters. This will help set the tone for the campaign, emphasizing the uniqueness of our adventure. I'm particularly interested in exploring custom magical items and magic in general, aiming to avoid generic tropes and create a more dynamic experience. Please be warned that these items and spells might be a bit unbalanced, as this is my first attempt at crafting custom content like this. My hope is that both you and the enemies you'll face will have access to powerful abilities, balancing things out in the end. 

To assist with balancing your custom magic item, I've included a helpful PDF, **[Sane Magical Prices](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yx4nLLKcEa7lnP0XKb6OXKEywx1OxdVN/view?usp=drive_link)**, which provides guidelines for pricing magical items. I would recommend using items that are uncommon and worth less than a few thousand gold from this PDF as templates and sources of inspiration for the powers and balancing of your item.

I am also open to using any content from the D&D 5e source material, including items, magic, and gods. However, I ask that you run significant changes or major content by me first so that we can work together to integrate it smoothly into the campaign.

## Campaign Setting

### The World of [[Xylaria]]

This campaign takes place on **[[Xylaria]]**, a planet composed of mismatched chunks from various realms across the multiverse. No one knows exactly what caused [[The Convergence]] thousands of years ago, but its effects are still evident today. Each realm contributes unique biomes, flora, fauna, and civilizations to [[Xylaria]]. A mysterious magical force maintains the conditions of each realm's origin within its boundaries, resulting in phenomena like permanent fog, eternal night, unique atmospheric colors, reduced gravity, extreme temperatures, and additional celestial bodies.

### [[Aosa]]

You will begin your adventure on the continent known as the **[[Aosa]]**. Over time, the civilizations of these disparate realms have reached an era of relative peace and calm. While some areas remain fraught with tension, others have formed alliances, leading to rapid technological advancements and artistic expression as new ideas cross borders.

### Starting Point: [[Trisfir Kingdom]]

Your journey begins in **[[Sylmare]]**, the capital city of the **[[Trisfir Kingdom]]**. This kingdom is renowned for its technological prowess, achieved through close collaboration with allies it's gained over many generations of negotiations and political maneuvering. [[Trisfir Kingdom]]'s relative calm and prosperity have turned it into a melting pot of diverse peoples and ideas. As a result, it commands a rich mercantile empire and competes to be the dominant power on the continent.

## Campaign Basics

You are currently contracted by **[[Clan Tanithil]]** within **[[Sylmare]]** to perform various tasks. This clan holds moderate to high power within the city's upper echelons, even having a seat on the [[Great Tribal Council]]. Presently, they have contracted your party to run odd jobs like guarding goods transports and resolving minor issues throughout the city. After successfully completing several assignments, your employer has improved your accommodations, and you now reside in a household considered somewhat lavish for a party of your level. While the property is quite nice, the interiors are relatively spartan, as you have recently moved in and haven't had time to personalize the space. 

Your party currently has some downtime within **[[Sylmare]]** as you await news of your next job.

## Campaign Background

### About Xylaria

Xylaria is a land of endless possibilities and intrigue. The unique convergence of realms has resulted in a world where different biomes and cultures coexist, sometimes in harmony, often in conflict. The mysterious forces that hold the realms together create a rich tapestry of environments and opportunities for adventure.

### About the [[Aosa]]

The [[Aosa]] is a vast expanse of land where diverse civilizations, each with its own history and culture, thrive. Here, the blending of ideas and the exchange of knowledge have led to an era of prosperity and innovation. However, underlying tensions remain, as ancient rivalries and newfound alliances shape the political landscape.

### About [[Trisfir Kingdom]]

The **[[Trisfir Kingdom]]** is a beacon of progress on the [[Aosa]]. Known for its technological advancements and cultural diversity, the kingdom has become a hub of commerce and diplomacy. Its strategic alliances and strong economy make it a formidable force, and its influence extends across the continent. On top of this, powerful ley lines cross this realm providing an abundance of magical energy across the land.

Over the years, the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] has cultivated alliances with some of its bordering realms. Most notably, the [[Kut'al Conclave]], inhabited by [[Rak'dynian Thri-kreen]], and the [[Gearspark Dominion]], inhabited by [[Tinker Gnome|Tinker Gnomes]]. These realms have come together and begun to rapidly increase their power within [[Aosa]] through the combination of each realms' magical properties and abilities. The [[Kut'al Conclave]] provides large crystals that can be imbued with the magical energy of each of the realms and then be used as a power source for magical abilities and effects. The [[Trisfir Kingdom]] is one of the most magically imbued realms within [[Aosa]], which allows for rapid charging of the [[Kut'al Conclave]]'s crystals when within the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. The charging is especially quick when close to the ley lines of the realm. On top of this the magical energy from the [[Trisfir Kingdom]] acts as a stable and potent power source. Finally, this is combined with the artifician abilities of the [[Gearspark Dominion]] to create sometimes wonderous and sometimes dubious magical artifacts and constructs.

### About [[Sylmare]]

**[[Sylmare]]** is the bustling capital city at the heart of the [[Trisfir Kingdom]]. It serves as a center for trade, innovation, and culture of the kingdom. The city's streets are predominantly filled with the original elvish inhabitants of the realm, but there is also a vibrant mix of other peoples from all walks of life. Both the [[Royal House]] and the [[Clans]] wield significant power, shaping the city's politics and economy.

The city of [[Sylmare]] is carved directly into the top of an enormous stump of an ancient redwood tree that has been petrified into stone. Parts of the inside of the stump have also been carved out to be utilized for more space for the populace as well as tunnels to navigate the city. The stump sits within a bay and is mostly bordered by land, with only a relatively small portion exposed to the open ocean. The roots of the stump act as natural bridges to the mainland as well as massive docks for the cities vibrant mercantile empire.

### About [[Clan Tanithil]]

**[[Clan Tanithil]]** is a prominent and influential player within **[[Sylmare]]**'s political landscape. Known for their shrewd business acumen and strategic alliances, they hold considerable sway over the city's affairs. The noble house has a reputation for hiring skilled adventurers to undertake various tasks, ensuring their interests are protected and their influence continues to grow.

## Closing

I would greatly appreciate it if you could share any of your character ideas with me as soon as you can. This will give me some time to work with you all to incorporate your ideas into the campaign. Do not feel obligated to have everything figured out upfront. As I mentioned above, I am planning on having a Session 0 where we can all sit down and finalize each of your characters and some other campaign details together before we start playing officially. 

If you have any additional ideas, questions, or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I value your feedback and input on how we can shape this campaign together.
